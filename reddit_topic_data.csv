climatechange,The r/climatechange Verified User Flair Program,"r/climatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change. As such, it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educated/informed opinions from general comments, and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this. 

# Do I qualify for a user flair?

As is the case in almost any science related field, a college degree (or current pursuit of one) is required to obtain a flair. Users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing [**redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com**](mailto:redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com) with information that corroborates the verification claim.

**The email must include:**

1. At least one of the following: A verifiable .edu/.gov/etc email address, a picture of a diploma or business card, a screenshot of course registration, or other verifiable information.
2. The reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph.
3. The desired flair: **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree Area | Additional Info**  (see below)

# What will the user flair say?

In the verification email, please specify the desired flair information. A flair has the following form:

>USERNAME    **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree area | Additional Info**

For example if reddit user “Jane” has a PhD in Atmospheric Science with a specialty in climate modeling, Jane can request:

>Flair text: PhD | Atmospheric Science | Climate Modeling

If “John” works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines, he could request:

>Flair text: Electrical Engineer | Wind Turbines

Other examples:

>Flair Text: PhD | Marine Science | Marine Microbiology
>  
>Flair Text: Grad Student | Geophysics | Permafrost Dynamics
>  
>Flair Text: Undergrad | Physics  
>  
>Flair Text: BS | Computer Science | Risk Estimates

Note: The information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information, but rather the broad degree area. (i.e. “John” above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer, but not that he works specifically on wind turbines).

# A note on information security

While it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information, we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation. Therefore, the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators, and emails are deleted after verification is completed. If you have any information security concerns, please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely.

# A note on the conduct of verified users

Flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct. This includes both the technical information  provided to the community, as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users. The moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance, especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users. Even if qualified, you are not entitled to a user flair.

# Thanks

climatechange,Why do so many people who say they're anxious about climate change seem to love the actual effects of climate change?,"I posted a complaint on the Massachusetts sub about how newscasters (including on NPR) keep normalizing our insanely warm temps, namely by being happy and excited about it being 80 degrees on Halloween and then referring to temps in the 50s (when it should be the 40s or even the 30s rn) as ""chilly"" and crying ""winter is coming"" after like 7 people said they saw some flakes of snow in NH.

In response to my post, I got enormous pushback from 90% of people, all saying basically yeah climate change is happening but these are just a few hot days not a trend, why be a jerk about it, and just enjoy the warmth like a normal person. I guess it's cool to love the effects of climate change while still smugging liberal by showing off your belief that climate change writ large is real. It's even more rich coming from a state that prides itself on its ""tough New Englander"" image, replete with putting on tire chains, skating on frozen ponds, and taking the T to ski at Wachusett. Like, none of those things are going to happen this year or probably any that follow...

I've decided that most people think like the following: abnormally warm weather is ""nice"" and, after having experienced a couple weeks of it, anything less than that abnormally warm weather is ""cold"" and thus bad. Like, it's going to be 77 in a couple days here, and I know for a fact that the news is going to say that when it drops to the upper 50s the next day that ""the cold will return"" or something like that, even though the upper 50s are themselves what would've been considered abnormally warm a couple decades ago. 

One comment on another sub I read recently said that they think no one seems to care about climate change since the pandemic. I think that's true. It's like how people are way less aghast by Trump now than 4 (let alone 8) years ago. We're kind of tired, bored, and nihilistic as a nation now. Slouching toward inundation by the seas, mosquitos in January, and a world with no snow forevermore.

climatechange,Took a Bad Turn,"Global air temperature was looking better since April, but recently turned higher, reaching +1.44 C anomaly for the date (Oct 30).  Getting close to the +1.53 C which drew widespread media alarm last year (Nov 17), termed ""gobsmackingly bananas hot"" by Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth.  Let's hope it has turned downward since (data 6 days delayed).  Last year's temperature pop was attributed to a reduction in aerosols from ship exhausts by some climatologists (notably James Hansen's group).

climatechange,Seeking studies to reference as family holidays approach ,"I’m really not sure where to ask this question but this sub seems like a good place(?)

My dad, my uncle, and a few other members of my family have been getting on my nerves for the past few years whenever I bring up environmental issues. 

I’ll say something like “it’s undeniable that humans have had a negative impact on the environment. And even if it wasn’t, what harm is there in encouraging people to live greener?”

And they’ll immediately laugh me off. Their counters tend to be along the lines of 

- “earth will be around long after we’re gone either way. Humanity has only been around for a blink of an eye and we’re too minuscule to actually harm the planet past the point of no return”

- “the earth naturally warms and cools anyway. How do we know that this faster cycle of warming has never happened *before* recorded history?” 

But what set me off the other day was a conversation I had with my uncle about the environmental impacts of big oil & gas companies. He is dead set on his belief that any source backing my claims is too biased to take seriously. He does not think it’s impact is any worse than an alternative energy source, and that the US should increase our oil & gas production (for political reasons that I won’t go into due to sub rules)

He also doubts the health concerns that come with poor air quality. Even further, he doubts that gas & oil actually have a tangible impact on the air quality at all. He again wouldn’t accept any sources I presented due to their “bias” and “fear mongering”

I just know I’m going to get roped back into this conversation come thanksgiving. My family is willing to change their opinions if I hear them out (because, granted, I never read/watch the things they send me as “proof” that *they’re* right) and can provide completely unbiased sources backing my claim.  

Does anyone know of any simple and strong stats/studies that they might respond to? It’d be great to have some on hand in the coming months :,)",climatechange,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1gjm5y9/seeking_studies_to_reference_as_family_holidays/,2024-11-04 18:59:47

climatechange,This Halloween is really warm. Kind of triggering my climate anxiety.,"I live in Pennsylvania where Halloween is never, ever supposed to be warm. The only time I ever experienced a warm Halloween before this was when I was living in Texas. And that's because in Texas, at least when I was there, it doesn't start to cool off until about Halloween. However, in the few short years since I've left Texas and moved back to Pennsylvania, my Texas friends tell me it doesn't start to cool down there until the end of November now.

Now I'm in PA and it's a warm Halloween. My neighbors upstairs have the AC running. It's Pennsylvania and it's Halloween. That's not supposed to be a thing that happens in Pennsylvania. Granted, my neighbors run the AC more than we do. Maybe they're more sensitive to the heat. Maybe it's because they're upstairs. But nobody in Pennsylvania, I mean nobody, runs AC on halloween. This is not normal. 

I just took my dog outside for a quick walk. I'm wearing a tank top, shorts, and flip-flops. It's Halloween and it's Pennsylvania. Did I say that this is not normal?

I'm sure if you look back over the last hundred years you might find a warm Halloween here or there as some anomaly. But this is clearly not an anomaly. This is the trend. 

In the 4 years that I was away from PA, I came back and could tell that the winters were much, much warmer. I thought the first one might have been one of those unusually warm winters, an anomoly. Okay honestly, I didn't think that. I hoped it. But deep down I knew it was climate change. And the following winter was warm. Than the one after that. And so on.    

In order to avoid climate anxiety, people tell you to avoid doom scrolling. I do that. 

Now I go outside and I can't help but notice the difference.  I try and reason it away. It's an anomaly. It's a warm front. Basically I try to lie to myself about how bad it is because I know it actually is bad. I'm not a climate change denier. Far from it. But I do try to lie to myself about it in an attempt to avoid climate anxiety. 

While I was in Texas, the grid almost failed and the state froze over. That was the start of my climate anxiety. 

It's been a lot better in Pennsylvania but the drastic changes that I've noticed in less than a decade is getting hard to ignore. 

Whenever I do read anything about climate change, I purposely seek out information about what people are doing. And there is a lot that people are doing. Technology, renewable energy, is rapidly advancing and solar in particular is cheaper than ever. Many governments are taking this seriously. They haven't done enough yet. But I'm seeing us moving on the right path, even if it is slower than I would like. That said,whatever we're going to experience in the next 30 years, there isn't much that will change it at this point.  

We aren't doomed. I don't think we are. I do think we will have several rough decades ahead of us though. Maybe a rough half century. We're moving in the right direction but that will not change the immediate future. At least I don't think it will. 

So I'm going to go back to lying to myself and pretending it's a warm front or something. Good night everyone.

climatechange,Invasive species,"Let me preface this by saying I understand the value of natives for biodiversity. Life has evolved alongside them, so certain species depend on them. 

But Invasive species have been conquering more and more of the world. Many humans aim to remove them to make room for natives again. 

To me it seems they are not considering the whole picture. If humans were to die out one day, the invasives would just come back anyways. So basically all we did was just delay evolution & natural succession and messed a little bit with the gene pool. 

Invasives are here now. I know people claim they do literally nothing for biodiversity but that’s not true. Nature adapts fast. I’ve seen many non native hedges and trees provide great bird & bug habitat. Also, over time these species would become more and more interconnected within an ecosystem. Removing invasives sets this process back. And in times of rapid climate change, we really can’t afford losing precious evolutionary adaptation.

In my eyes, invasives are very valuable in the fight against climate change. Tree of heaven for example grows crazy fast, sucking up a lot of carbon. It’s a perfect tree for pollarding and using the sticks as an energy source (I.e. in a rocket stove) in a carbon negative way, since the roots remain in ground and you’re not killing the tree when you’re harvesting it’s wood. 

My point is, that removing invasives to plant natives doesn’t always make sense, if the natives don’t have their preferred range of conditions anymore in 50-100 years and will end up being replaced by better adapted invasives anyways. 

Work with nature instead of against it. ",climatechange,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ght2jb/invasive_species/,2024-11-02 09:58:16

climatechange,I started a project for everyone who wants to maximize their positive climate impact,"A lot of people ask, what they can do individually, in addition to lifestyle changes, to maximize their positive impact on climate and environment. Asking that myself, and researching flaws of available alternatives, led me to start a new project, to allow individuals to take measurable climate action through participation in forest restoration at scale.

Of course it should be treated as a complementary solution to political pressure and necessary systemic changes, and not as excuse to continue current state of affairs. But if we can do something extra in the meantime, why not? After all, we have to not only reduce our emissions, but also recapture already emitted CO2.

We are dedicated to plant new forests with mainly ecological functions and not industrial monocultures, to make an actual land cover change and provide additional ecosystem services. We also include trees’ survivability rate in our impact calculations, to not overestimate it. We partner with municipalities and regions, which provide necessary land, and already few of them declared interest in our project.

Our project allows to gradually build towards tangible impact through planting subscriptions. In our case, they are different from other subscription-based services, as you don’t lose your impact when decide to cancel it, as already planted trees will keep recapturing CO2 for you. Such model just makes reaching a proper scale of impact more available.

We also provide feedback on your planting contributions and CO2 recapture journey.

Currently we are building an international community of individuals, who would like to take such climate action with us, so I’d like to invite you to join and bring in your friends!

The thing that is bothering me right now, is wildfires and forest regeneration. 

Trees burn, leaving charcoal and grasses in their wake. The grasses choke out any trees, and are also easier to burn next season. Trees take decades to grow assuming conditions are right, and longer if the conditions aren't right. Shouldn't this mean that there's no way for trees to be replaced at this point? I mean they're still being replaced sure, but the replacement rate- shouldn't that be falling faster than it's growing?

I don't even really mean carbon release itself, I'm mostly worried about the ecological transformation of forests being unable to re-establish themselves in the wake of fires.

climatechange,Why have fuel efficiency gains in combustion engine cars seemingly plateaued?,"The 90s saw some seriously impressive MPG figures for the time. There were some entry-level vehicles getting in the combined 30s MPG ranges, albeit with much less power than today. And in an era when gas prices were less important and most Americans didn't know about climate change.

Average US gas prices were around $1.11 in 1993 and $3.22 in 2023, a 190% increase compared to 111% cumulative inflation over the same period.

It's really hard to get reputable MPG figures for 90s cars. Internet sites vary wildly. But if you compare 1993 to 2023 you'd think those 30 years would mean a much better MPG improvement than we've had. And with newer technology should mean lighter materials against their strength and that this would be exemplified by lighter cars. Every car seems to be heavier these days than their 90s iterations. How have cars gotten heavier?

Is it because combustion engine technology has plateaued? Is it because cars are heavier now due to safety/impact regulations? Is it because people in America now expect more performance compared to the 125-160 HP figures that entry-level cars in the 90s made? Is it because we've traded pure MPG figures for better gas-specific emissions (less harmful gasses emitted per gallon instead of more miles per gallon)?",climatechange,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1gg78q0/why_have_fuel_efficiency_gains_in_combustion/,2024-10-31 05:20:16

Last week, the Australian government’s Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry finished up on a timber testing trial that investigated the best way to implement technologies verifying claims of species and harvest origin of regulated timber and timber products.

According to Matt Lowe, Australia’s Deputy Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Policy, illegal timber accounts for 15-30% of all wood traded globally: “Using timber testing technologies will strengthen Australia’s ongoing efforts to address this problem by enhancing existing compliance and due diligence efforts under our illegal logging prohibition laws.”

“They offer a means of verifying if claims made about the species and harvest origin of timber are accurate. The trial tested 146 products and 39 distinct species. A range of scientific methods were used, including DNA, stable isotope, trace element, wood fibre and wood anatomy analyses,” he said.",climatechange,54,https://woodcentral.com.au/crackdown-up-to-30-of-timber-at-australian-ports-could-be-illegal/,2024-10-30 12:48:45

Yet there's more and more chatter about building more solar and wind farms and investing in these renewable sources - while we all know we need a mix of different renewables to really make a difference. It's the same old story for everyone - the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow... yea yea... you can see it especially in the UK where wind energy drops off dramatically during the summer.

I've been following CorPower Ocean's journey (https://corpowerocean.com/a-short-history-of-wave-energy/) for a while now, and I'm really chuffed about their recent big investment. While I'm glad there's more discussion about ocean energy, I really feel there's a lack of talks about tidal energy. Tidal energy is predictable and reliable, and I know some people say it's not always there, but as long as the moon and gravity exist, tides are pretty much always around - not like waves, solar, wind, etc., which depend on the weather.

There are already some great tidal energy technologies that can produce clean and, most importantly, reliable energy - like Orbital Marine Power, Nova, and my favourite one because of their seashell design and technology that's completely 3D printed and, as I understand it, much cheaper than other technologies - Spiralis Energy (https://www.spiralis.energy). Yet, they all lack investment, and more importantly, tidal energy itself isn't getting the buzz it deserves, even though it could be a really big deal.

climatechange,"""Helene and Milton upended a key part of the nation’s agriculture system""","Climate change magnified the destructiveness of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and southeastern agricultural/food production apparently suffered the consequences.

>After a spectacular burst of rapid intensification, [Hurricane Helene made landfall](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCUAT4+shtml/DDHHMM.shtml) just east of the mouth of the Aucilla River, about 10 miles west-southwest of Perry, Florida, at about 11:10 p.m. EDT Thursday. Top sustained winds were estimated at 140 mph, making Helene a Category 4 hurricane at landfall....

>A 4-5% increase in hurricane winds may not seem like a big deal, but damage from a hurricane increases exponentially with an increase in winds. For example, according to NOAA, a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph (161 kph) winds will do 10 times the damage of a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (121 kph) winds. This includes damage not only from winds but also from storm surge, inland flooding, and tornadoes. **Bottom line: A 4-5% increase in winds yields about a 40-50% increase in hurricane damage** (Figure 1).

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/four-ways-climate-change-likely-made-hurricane-helene-worse/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/four-ways-climate-change-likely-made-hurricane-helene-worse/)

>Milton’s 11% increase in winds because of human-caused climate change likely made it nearly twice as destructive.

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/without-climate-change-hurricane-milton-would-have-hit-as-a-cat-2-not-a-cat-3/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/without-climate-change-hurricane-milton-would-have-hit-as-a-cat-2-not-a-cat-3/)

>America depends on Southeastern agriculture. After two hurricanes and billions of dollars in damages, the US food supply chain faces an uncertain future.

>[The storm battered six states](https://grist.org/extreme-weather/after-battering-coastal-towns-hurricane-helene-causes-deadly-flooding-across-five-states/), causing billions of dollars in losses to crops, livestock, and aquaculture. Just 13 days later, [Milton barreled across Florida](https://grist.org/extreme-weather/after-milton-florida-assesses-damage-from-back-to-back-climate-disasters/), leaving millions without power and hampering ports, feed facilities, and fertilizer plants along the state’s west coast. 

>Preliminary estimates suggest Helene, one of the nation’s deadliest and costliest hurricanes since Katrina in 2005, upended hundreds of thousands of businesses throughout the Southeast and devastated a wide swath of the region’s agricultural operations. Milton’s impact was more limited, but the two calamities are expected to reduce feed and fertilizer supplies and increase production costs, which could drive up prices for things like chicken and fruit in the months and years to come.

EDIT:  As a result of accelerating ocean heat content, hurricane intensity is increasing.  So southeastern agricultural production may increasingly see severe disruptions.

>The eight Cat 4 and 5 landfalls since 2017: Harvey (2017 in Texas), Irma (2017 in Florida), Maria (2017 in Puerto Rico), Michael (2018 in Florida), Laura (2020 in Louisiana), Ida (2021 in Louisiana), Ian (2022 in Florida), Helene (2024 in Florida).

>The eight Cat 4 and 5 landfalls in the prior 57 years: Charley, 2004; Andrew, 1992; Hugo, 1989; Celia, 1970; Camille, 1969; Betsy, 1965; Carla, 1961; Donna, 1960.

A northern shift in the jet stream due to climate change (Arctic Amplification) also may negatively impact agricultural production.  As the jet stream creates wind shear which suppresses hurricanes, a northern shift in the jet stream also may increase the frequency of hurricanes.

climatechange,The Hate for Hydrogen,"While I like this sub, the hydrogen discussions, especially around green hydrogen, make me wanna hit my head into a wall; every discussion seems to be on the use of hydrogen as energy storage, or involved is some Power-to-X scheme, and everyone seems to be missing the other side of the hydrogen industry.

Its a chemical.

Its properties as an energy vector are suboptimal at best; low efficiencies, hydrogen leakage/embrittlement etc. But it is still one of the most important chemicals on the planet, and I dont see why there is such a push back against decarbonising its production.

Its vital in agriculture, through the HB process, and agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of global CO2 emissions.

It can be used as a replacement for carbon in Steel production, another huge emitter of CO2 \~8% of emissions.

It can even be used to greatly reduce the CO2 used in the concrete industry, or even the production of rocket fuel.

Although climate change discussions tend to revolve around the energy sector, huge decarbonisation still needs to be carried out across all industries, and imo this is where green hydrogen really shines.",climatechange,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1geal2u/the_hate_for_hydrogen/,2024-10-28 19:18:05

Education in the U.S. is in a state of flux. The [pandemic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-pandemic-disrupted-adolescent-brain-development/) has left students across the country with learning gaps, [especially in math and science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10028259/). Teacher turnover is [high](https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/3/6/23624340/teacher-turnover-leaving-the-profession-quitting-higher-rate/), with some areas hit by staffing shortages. Schools are increasingly targeted in [mass shootings ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mass-shootings-will-keep-spiraling-upward-without-big-changes-in-gun-laws/)and effectively segregated by race. Public schools face budget cuts and declining enrollment, while states across the country are allowing taxpayer dollars to fund private education instead.

The two current presidential candidates propose two sharply different paths forward for the U.S. education system. Former president Donald Trump favors what’s known as school choice, or privatization, and increasing [government involvement in curriculum](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/floridas-attacks-on-education-threaten-science/). Vice President Kamala Harris supports programs to address inequity across early childhood, K–12 and higher education. [Here’s how their policy proposals measure up](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-and-harris-have-vastly-different-plans-for-public-education/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit).

education,Is K-12 private education “worth it”?,"I want to hear from those of you that went to a private school or have kids enrolled in a private/independent school (or graduated from one)!

Was it worth it?

Some background: as our kids are getting closer to middle school age, we are considering moving from public to private. Tuition is about $60k (total for all kids). While we can afford it, I have a hard time wrapping my mind around this because I wonder if it would be best to put this money aside from them and into a high yield saving account so that they have money for college or even a down payment on their first home. So… was private worth it for you and your family? 

Did you or your child (whoever went to a private school):

- acquire a helpful/influential network of people through the school?
- receive a lot of support when it came time to apply for college?
- have a great college resume because of all the extracurriculars and coursework offered at the school?
- feel that you learned great life skills at the school that may be commonly overlooked in public schools?
- feel like you were “seen” and not lost in the crowd?
- feel ready for college?
- AND THE BIG Q: could you have accomplished all this at a public school?

education,"Im not entirely sure if this where this belongs, but HERE WE GO","I will preface this with; I am in no way blaming the teachers and im sorry if this turns into a emotionally charged mess

But I have decided I want to help reform the education system for the better. Not only is it pathetically inefficient, it leaves its mark on you

I still wake up at 4 am, despite being piss-tired and have trouble falling back asleep as im 'supposed to be doing something' - Back in high school, yeah! Now adays? Not so much, im struggling to even get a job

Now, onto the promised 'inefficiencies' - In my eyes, the education system is just a series of numbers and letters to brag to other countries about, my main proof being dedicated spanish class

We HAD to be taught it, no one wanted to and it was understood to just be a part of the system. I scored terrible cause I barely tried. Others didnt try, at all and we all passed. This isnt even like, 'oh they're freshmen' no, we were on our way to becoming Seniors' the next year

other inefficiencies, include the 'Zero Tolerance' policy, of which personally effected me (yay) - Not giving teachers the time and money they deserve for being teachers thus leading to burnt out husks like the students

Expecting too much in too little a time. A kid who is really great at one thing at age five doesnt mean they'll be really great at it, age 19. Or vice versa

K-5, atleast when I experienced it, was glorified daycare with a mix of common sense thrown in. The only thing I actually learned was multiplication and division. 

Alot of this, sounds pretty tame or inconsequential, and thats the problem. Its not just one problem that can be tackled. Its a mess of things going wrong either due to personal problems, preferences, or goverment red tape

Im not gonna just flail my arms and pout though, I have some solutions

Monthly/Bi-Monthly/Quarterly teaching (and 'open-end' learning)

This one is oddly specific, but hear me out. Everyone learns in different ways, so this one is meant to account for that. You have your planning ahead of time so those who speed away arent punished / have to wait for everyone else.

While those that need a bit of extra help can use the past for reference material. Though there's a bit more to this idea

What I imagine, in a dream scenario is one topic, three class rooms. Lets saaay... Science. Its a nice blend of english and math 

One classroom is the normal 'everyday' classroom we all know. Another, is more direct. The 'lab' as some might call it. Some people are very textile learners.

The last leans a bit more into the grain, to say. And Im not sure how to explain it but I can give a example

During one assigment we were taught to explain the water cycle, and no matter how I put it, it sounded like I was giving a business presentation. So I turned it into a story, about 'Jim the Raindrop' - even referencing other lessons. 

That is what the third classroom would be. Those who think a bit outside the box

Again, perfect world dream here speaking but unlikely to happen; Your allowed to leave the class room and go to a different one of these three if you feel it might help you better. 

I also understand this is going to put a odd strain on teachers, due to some people  being slower than the rest, others being faster and thus having answers to different tests to grade. If your particularly unlucky and have a class chock-full of fast folk you'll have alot of tests. 

I got a solution to that, too! 

The teachers all grade them, yes but also, there would be a college-grade professor to reference. So if a teacher doesnt know something, or their overworked they can reference the professor

This also allows students to get a taste of college. I know some teachers will have students grade paper work, which I can also see working but requires a bit more handling, I might be wrong

Though one person covering three people may be too much, so I also propose that the kids who actively like a subject can be the ones who help the teacher out.

I understand this is a swift way to make a 'teachers pet' problem, Which will be pointed out in my next 'problem' thing. Though if a student actively enjoys doing English, and is going to write you a 150 word story on everything you can fix 

Then let em. They're enjoying themselves, letting you know how to improve, and giving a example in one blow

  
The next problem; The problem of peer-to-peer problems such as bullying, or public exile

School, in of itself, is a way to make connections, friends, and all that stuff.

So there is no way to 'fix' the problem of bullying, public exile, or whatever. Though we can try to mitigate it. 

I propose two solutions. The Anynomous Mailbox and, The Whiteboard

The Anon Mailbox, is a simple mailbox in various locations where you write something down and put it in. Simple, Done

Now I know humans, myself included, are very dumb so this will VERY swiftly not work. But I truthfully cant think of anything better of a way to report problems if you dont feel you can find safety in your teachers

The other solution, The Whiteboard

Have various white boards or tack boards or whatever across the school that students are free to mess with. Either it be just 'have a nice day' or a doodle their proud of, or a 'Hey, party at my place (Address)' or whatever. It gives a way to talk to people, without having to actually TALK to people

It also allows for groups to find one another easier. Such as ""Hey I wanna run a dnd game, text (number) if you wanna join"" or ""Hey, I lost my soccer ball but I still wanna play. Anyone up for some?"" 

Theoretically this could also be used like the Anon Mailbox but people may start recognizing hand writing so, do that at your own peril. 

Slightly askew; The Teachers Pet

This is from the above problem but, for those unfamiliar, a 'teachers pet' is someone the public labels as a giant nerd and suck-up to the teacher. 

Im hoping the fact im basically trying to re-write the entire idea of a school will eliminate this problem. 

There is no real way to 'fix' the public eye. So, I hope with all my heart that if the schooling system does get fixed. Its in a way that doesnt make more problems

education,"Realistically, which degree would be best suited to careers such as Support Teacher, Community Learning, Art Therapist, Mental Health or Learning Difficulties (Adults or Children) Support Worker","Currently I am thinking of the following, I want to know which of these would be most likely to be an asset to me in getting myself into any of the above fields. **I am aware that some of these require additional education after my first degree** such as a specialised Art Therapist course or possibly a teaching course for becoming a support teacher? I'm not sure.

\- Social Work (I don't do well in high-stress real life situations so the actual role Social Worker would not be a good fit, but if this could lead into any of the above careers mentioned that would be perfect since it covers a wide range of subjects related to a lot of what I am hoping to get into)

\- Psychology (I do, however, do well in high-stress academic situations so I would be able to handle a degree in some form of psychology, and would be able to start at year 2 from previous learning. However, I have heard that Psychology is not useful in the real world unless you do further studies afterwards, so i'm not sure.)

\- Education (Primary level probably, However I don't want to be a teacher, I am interested in becoming a support teacher because I am interested in supporting children with learning difficulties or physical disabilities. I currently work with children part time who have learning difficulties, and it's a rewarding and enjoyable job)

\- Community Learning and Development (No clue how useful this would be since it's not a widely recognised degree, and I would rather choose an alternative path that could also lead into this kind of work, as I have been on the learners side of CLD and it helped me get my life to the point it is now, I want to be able to do that for other people)

\- Counselling (As I have said of other degrees, I don't want to do the specific counsellor or therapist role, I have been and still am the ""therapist"" friend and it is mentally draining and I know for a fact I would not handle that at all as a full time job, but again if this could lead me into any of the careers in the title I will consider it)

\- Childhood practice (This would allow me to continue in my current work which I do enjoy, but would it help towards any of the other jobs I could see myself doing?)

\- Any other degree you think would be good for what I'm aiming for, I'm super confused about what would be a good path, I feel like if I complete a degree I would need to be sure its an asset rather than a waste of time, so any advice would be helpful.",education,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1giuw59/realistically_which_degree_would_be_best_suited/,2024-11-03 19:24:24

education,Building a gamified learning app - How would you design the 'perfect' learning experience?,"Hi everyone! I'm developing an Android app that turns learning into an interactive game - whether it's coding, languages, or any new subject. Think Duolingo meets RPG, but more flexible for different subjects.

Core features I'm planning:
- Progressive difficulty levels for each topic
- Real-world examples and practical applications
- Interactive quizzes with immediate feedback
- Global leaderboard system

What I'd love to know from you:
1. What makes learning ""stick"" for you? 
2. What gaming elements have you found most motivating in educational apps? (Streaks? Achievements? Social features?)
3. For those who've used apps like Duolingo/Codecademy - what do you wish they did differently?
4. How important is real-world application vs. theoretical knowledge in your learning journey?

I believe learning becomes more effective when it's broken down into manageable chunks with constant feedback and practical application. But I'd love to hear your learning approaches and what would make you excited to open a learning app daily.

I made this with the hope of obtaining greater education equality compared to the huge differences that currently exist between states. Please let me know your thoughts!

**Proposed Federal Standard:**

* 4 Social Studies
* 4 English
* 3 Science
* 3 Mathematics
* 2 Life Skills
* 2 World Language
* 1 Arts
* 1 Athletics
* 4 Elective
* 24 Credits Total

**Academic Base:** The average required credits by most universities serves as the foundation which consists of 4 English, 3 Social Studies, 3 Science, 3 Mathematics, and 2 World Language credits.

**Social Studies:** Increased from 3 to 4 credits due to the critical lack of informed citizenship within many real life applicable social studies topics among the US population.

**Arts & Athletics:** Both are 1 credit each to solidify teacher employment and funding to programs typically considered more leisure based and less academic than other subjects.

**Life Skills:** New subject including physical, mental, and social health alongside financial, career, and home wellness. 2 credits required, 1 in 9th grade covering ""High School Life Prep"" and 1 in 12th grade covering ""Adult Life Prep"" with available electives throughout high school.

**Electives:** Class choices based on individual student interests throughout all 8 standard subjects. The amount of elective credits available depends on the school size and schedule type, generally 4 with 6 periods, 8 with 7 periods, or 12 with an 8 period A|B day schedule.

**Course Requirements:** Revised within each subject for a greater real life focus. For example, Social Studies prioritizing Government & Economics over History and Mathematics prioritizing Statistics & Computer Science over Algebra and Geometry.

**State Flexibility:** Rural and or smaller schools with less access to say World Language, Life Skills, or specific course teachers may have credit requirements altered or waived on a case by case basis.",education,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1gi3bsg/reformed_us_high_school_graduation_required/,2024-11-02 18:44:42

education,"15-Year-Old Here, Sickened by How Disrespectful Some Kids My Age Are Towards Teachers and Learning","I’m 15, born in 2009, and I keep hearing stories about teachers quitting because students my age are so disrespectful – some even assault teachers. These kids apparently don’t care about learning at all; I’ve heard that many have reading levels as low as 1st grade by the time they’re in 7th grade. Honestly, I’m shocked and ashamed.

Back in 5th grade, I already had a 9th-grade reading level. COVID hit when I was in 5th grade, and I missed my elementary graduation. Doing 6th grade online was a mess for me – I completely failed because I didn’t understand the material and was barely logging on. The cops even showed up at my house because I wasn’t attending. I was eventually forced back to in-person school and stayed there for a while, but I went back to online school near the end of 8th grade and I’m still in online school now in 10th grade.

I have ADHD and dyslexia, so learning and focusing have always been challenges for me, but I still make the effort to read and write. Growing up, I was left alone a lot and spent tons of time online. My parents didn’t really supervise me or push me to succeed, yet I still managed to keep my respect for adults and stay focused on learning. I see other kids my age who were raised similarly, yet they act completely different.

People keep saying it’s “because of COVID,” and I get that it was hard on everyone. But that excuse only goes so far. I know a lot of kids had a rough time with online school, but that doesn’t explain why so many now treat their teachers horribly or why they seem completely uninterested in basic skills like reading and writing.

Since I’m in online school, I don’t know for sure if things are really as bad as I’ve been hearing. Maybe it’s not this extreme everywhere, but from what I’ve heard, it’s happening enough that it’s driving teachers away. It’s embarrassing to think this is how my generation is being seen by adults.

I’ve mostly seen adults talk about this problem, so I wanted to share my perspective as someone actually in this age group. I’m honestly disgusted by how some kids are reportedly treating adults and how little respect they have for learning. Is anyone else my age feeling this way?

education,Gifted and ESE funding,"TLDR: crowd-sourcing grade-level teacher salaries for gifted students disillusioned with the pace of gen-ed classroom.  

My son’s school has a disproportionate number of highly achieving students. We are a beach community attached to a largely agricultural community. The beach part of our school district is wealthier families (upper-middle to upper income), the other parts of the district are not as wealthy (working poor to middle income). I deliberately avoid the word ‘class’ as I just can’t seem to equate income and class. So I understand the point of view our district has regarding hiring a gifted teacher at my son’s school. I’m able to organize funds, we have community support behind the idea, but when we brought the plan - to use community fund raising to hire an additional set of teachers for each grade to have a teacher - we were met with the argument that it’s not legal to have such an arrangement at one school in the district without implementing it everywhere; the equivalent of making every student in a class wait on every other student to complete a task before moving on, except this is with an entire school. 

I get the critique. It’s elitist, it’s not fair, it’s a whole different level of disparity. But the reality is, my son is very high IQ, and we as parents spend more time crafting his mind than even most around here. So, when he comes home hating school, feeling depleted, and expressing despair with being required to complete menial tasks, I see his love of learning draining from his body and I hate it. Before we pull him, and all the social-emotional implications that come with that, I want to see if you guys know a way we can force the district’s hand to allow us to crowdsource a special education teacher to supplement the district funded staff.

Anyhoo, my son is only just 2 but he’s left me wondering about how he knows/understands what he does almost since the newborn stage. He’s not super out there doing crazy savant stuff, he's mostly just a really sweet normal kid (albeit a lot more switched on), but it’s become pretty apparent that he’s very, very smart and there’s a couple key things he’s done that tell me he’s likely legitimately gifted (not just advanced etc). BUT he’s also quite interested in people and is very social (it’s a core interest of his along with more academic stuff—hard to weight them at such an early age but I’d say 50-50). I do not want to isolate this kid. But I also don’t want to choose the wrong education for him.

Schools around here need years of advance planning, but I found an amazing one that aligns with my values. It’s very difficult to get in and there are fees just to apply of course. The day I was filling out the paperwork he read his first word by himself (hence why some strange internet dude decided to diagnose him with autism & hyperlexia without asking whether he had any signs of either of those conditions😣). Like I said, theres been a lot of things that made me get the feeling he was jst a lot more switched on, but this was one of a couple key things that told my objective brain this is likely true. He likely is actually gifted.

I’m completely aware there’s no way to tell for sure, and assessing him is the last thing on my mind, but I do want to make the best decisions for him going forward. I’ve read primary kids don’t need gifted programs. And I’d love if that was the case (I actually hate the idea of labelling him and sorting him out of the grouP—it seems sad and potentially super toxic). Someone recommended a book about the 5 levels of gifted, but at this point I see things my son has done essentially on every level so it’s not a huge help. The school I want to send him to doesn’t have a gifted program, but they work one-on-one with kids and closely with parents. Kids also have the opportunity to do private tutelage in music etc during class hours. I feel like this would be an amazing place for him but I don’t know the first thing about these kids’ needs. Do they actually need a “gifted” program???

Can anyone advise/put my mind at ease?

education,"Dear, students, teachers, mentors, and coaches, why does online education suck so much?","Hey teachers, and fellow students



Is it only me or I feel like online education sucks.



The teachers just give us random pre-made modules, and expect us to just ""learn & study"" from them. Then we are all brought together to ""Test"".



Why I think online education sucks

\- Online education is usually poorly structured

\- We aren't applying the information enough? Or applying the information incorrectly

\- We aren't doing the right and necessary actions to learn, and achieve

\- Mentor / Coaches / Teachers don't know what we students do on a day - day basis therefore they don't know where exactly the students need to help.



I know this sub-reddit is called ""teachers"" But really Im talking to online education as a whole, teachers, mentors, gurus, coaches, etc.

I will transition to a RL around the end of the school year. I plan to do a residency/licensure-only program so I won’t attain another degree right now. In NC, you are considered a Beginning Teacher for your first three years of teaching and most masters programs require either an undergrad education degree or at least three years of teaching experience. My license area is going to be K-6 meaning that not only can I teach elementary but also any subject 6th grade, however, my specialty is math. So when I start on my masters degree I don’t want really want to get it in elementary education because I don’t really want to teach any lower than 5th grade (I teach 6th grade math now) and don’t necessarily want to get it in middle grades either.

That being said, I also want to aim to be an administrator after 5–10 years of teaching. That begs a couple questions:

Should I get a Ed.M. in Educational Leadership or a Master of School Administration? (I lean towards MSA since it deals more with the literal administration and operations of the school)

Should I go ahead and start the masters program right after year 3 or later on?

I'm not kidding about being entirely focused on that, or exaggerating. He even says at one point in the video, ""I hate dirty rotten cheaters.""

I don't cheat.

However, he also claims he uses a software, and can personally detect, AI written papers.

This is giving me a huge amount of anxiety that my paper will mistakenly be caught using AI software even when it hasn't. I already have a huge amount of stress. I'm taking 20 credits this semester and I have two jobs. The first 10 are done and I just need to knock these out. I'm ssoooo close to graduating I can taste it.

I have family friends as well who have taught for 20+ years and everyone is leaving in droves!!! For many reasons im sure. The pay is awful, the students are becoming uncontrollable, also the risk of just being shot in a school here is a high possibility.

Something I am gathering is that these kids for some reason dont know how to write a full sentence, can barely read, and dont have many critical thinking skills. I think a heavy part is social media, however, reading and typing is a HUGE part of social media (commenting/texting/DMing/reading comments/reading basic captions on posts). I think “No kid left behind” has completely screwed us. The thought of being held back used to scare the hell out of me throughout my WHOLE school career. And i grew up with early early social media introductions. My coworker will bring in the math homework her 6th grader has and when i tell you it’s LITERALLY just coloring in patterns. No math equations, no +,-,x, or division. 

As a 24 year old Gen Z in an alright public school, my peers and I in 2nd grade were reading at a 5th grade + reading level, we could draft and write a 5 paragraph essay in 45 minutes, cursive was highly encouraged but kinda fell off, we still had to be able to read it.

How have we regressed so bad? How do we fix it? Even if you arent a student/teacher, you should be extremely ALARMED!! These are our children we are failing. These are our future doctors, nurses, lawyers, salesmen, TEACHERS, policemen/women. I dont want to be under the knife of a doctor who couldn’t read till he was in high school. 

(DISCLAIMER!!!!): I understand there are kids who dont have the resources to further their education and are at a disadvantage, this is not directed towards these students!! I hear that there are very privileged students who just dont apply themselves!!

education,Can public schools unit early learning with childcare?,"During the interminable 2024 presidential campaign, the cost of daycare was often mentioned during debates and in speeches. The two needs are not unrelated—they overlap. Cities like San Francisco (where I live) are facing school closures due to falling enrollment. Schools in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods could improve the childhood development (like Head Start) and save families, especially working mothers, time and money.

Offer parents a longer school year (230-250 days), eliminate ""summer slide,"" and associate learning with play and joy. Underused schools could become an extension of recreation centers. Teachers should get higher pay for more days. The added cost could be shared by local, state, and federal funding, with a generous heap of philanthropic support. There would be little risk in having a few charter schools across the country try this out where there is adequate public interest. We need both early intervention in education and affordable childcare. Why not combine the two?

education,Is this the modern classroom? ,"I'm a parent, not a teacher. My daughter is in sixth grade and her classroom experience is wildly different than any I have been in so I am attempting to understand how classrooms are typically structured in order to support her at home. The method that is used by at least one of her teachers is called the ""modern classroom"". Everything is on the computer on canvas, kids come into the classroom and get started on the work they need to do. It doesn't sound like there is a lecture followed by an assignment, which would have been more typical of a traditional classroom in my experience.

Most of her other classes operate in a similar way, as far as students opening their computer and doing whatever work needs to be done. Most of her math is on the computer as well and is multiple choice, so there is no opportunity to show work or for the teacher to understand where a student may be making mistakes. 

The lack of structure is an absolute disaster for my daughter because she is autistic and ADHD. Although they are assigned very little true homework, they do need to complete everything at home that doesn't get done in the classroom so the backlog is large. Task initiation, executive functioning, organization is all challenging for kids with this profile, but it seems like these are big asks for any 11/12 year old. 

I'm currently in grad school and most of my classes are not even this self-directed. There are weekly lectures, deadlines, and structure. It really feels like there was a shift when everything moved to remote and we are sticking with it. For example, in one of her classes while is is IN the classroom, she opens up her computer and watches a video of her teacher doing the worksheet and then copies the answers down. 

I'm not here to criticize teachers. I am trying to understand whether this is typical and if so, how are 6th graders managing? ",education,303,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1gbemwp/is_this_the_modern_classroom/,2024-10-24 22:01:41

I'm an instructor for a college level course and my own research is on AI so I do encourage the usage of chatgpt. I want one of my lectures to be on successful usage of chatgpt and I need ideas on what to add in my lecture. my mentality is that generative AI is a tool that will not go away, so if someone chooses not to use this tool, they might as well go back to handwashing their clothes. If they don't use this tool, they will soon be behind people who know how to navigate AI well. 

I think guidance on how to use generative AI properly for college level classes is important and beneficial to their entire college career. I drafted a few points to discuss with them on when they SHOULD use chatgpt, such as checking their grammar or if they can't find a way to word a sentence properly. i plan on showing them how critical thinking and smart choices of words with chatgpt can help them develop plans for their research and steer away from general ideas that AI throws out.

does anyone have any tips on when they would advise students to use AI?",education,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1gc8n6k/looking_to_teach_students_how_to_use_chatgpt/,2024-10-26 00:12:12

education,"How to keep your kids ""good"" in a bad school district","We live in a horrible school district. They report very low test scores, reading  proficiency, and college preparedness, but what I'm more concerned about is the general culture of the district which is a rough area with higher than average gang/drug related crime. The specific neighborhood I'm in is quiet, clean, and safe, but 2 miles down the road where the high school is is real bad. Charter school isn't an option financially so I feel like I'll have to send my kids to this school district when the time comes.

How do my husband and I keep them from mixing in with the wrong crowd and picking up bad behaviors when they're in an under-funded, run down, frankly bad school for 8 hours a day with a large majority of peers from really rough neighborhoods? I mean, they'll have to make friends at some point. The odds of them associating with troublemakers are a lot higher than if we lived in a better district. Any advice?

I am sick of mindlessly going to the same sites, and I want to use my idle time more beneficially.

Basically what I'm looking for is a hub for a wide array of information that is broken down into categories of educational topics. History, Science, Art.

  
w3schools provides a working knowledge of coding in a variety of languages; I'm hoping to find something that is similar to that, but for a wide array of topics, or if not that, a site that is essentially an array of links that takes you to that information. 

  
I am familiar with wikipedia, I am just hoping to see if something more minimalistic existed. If not, I think I might try to make something like that.

a) Companies don't actually care about their employee's learnings and is mostly a formality

b) For employees, it is sorta formality for them as well just to sit throught it, pass tests if any (most of them don't end up doing it if they don't have tests check in).

education,Created an AI-powered learning path tool to help students track & verify their progress - looking for educator feedback,"Hi. Passionate developer here sharing a tool I developed to address a common challenge in personalized learning. I'd love your professional feedback.

**Context:** After providing countless 1-on-1 mentoring sessions, I noticed students often struggle not with finding resources, but with:

* Structuring their learning journey
* Maintaining accountability
* Verifying their understanding
* Following through on practice

**The Solution:** [**Creative Minds Think Alike (CMTA)**](https://cmind.buzzchat.site) I developed an adaptive guidance tool that:

1. Takes a student's learning goal
2. Asks 5 diagnostic questions to assess:
   * Current knowledge level
   * Learning style preferences
   * Available resources
   * Time commitment
   * Specific objectives
3. Generates a structured learning path with:
   * Concrete tasks and milestones
   * Built-in verification steps
   * Progress tracking
   * Optional comprehension quizzes

**Example Application:** Student input: ""I want to learn Python programming"" The tool then:

* Assesses programming background
* Identifies specific use cases (data analysis, web dev, etc.)
* Creates tailored tasks with proof of completion requirements
* Adapts difficulty based on demonstrated understanding

**Educational Theory Background:** This approach incorporates:

* Bloom's Taxonomy for task progression
* Active recall principles
* Metacognitive strategies
* Scaffolded learning

**Looking for Feedback:**

* How could this better support your classroom needs?
* What additional features would help verify student progress?
* How might this complement existing educational technologies?

I'm not selling anything - just wanting to improve this tool to better serve educators and students.

Subplots mission includes searching for a serial killer, closing down an illegal weapon ring or a forced prostitution ring.

The vehicles and the guns all feel real. The police is a real pain in the ass to get rid off. Their is this mega computer surveillance thing called CTOS and the big company behind that's blume. There are important part of the story but not the main part.

In WD 2, the world feel like an amusement park. The plot is just that CTOS sucks and that's not cool, so you and your crew of over the caricature of nerds are gonna tear it down. And the way to do it is to acquire followers that basically lend you their computer's power as long as they follow you.

One of the first side mission is about preventing a billionaire to keep some rappers' new album all by himself...

The guns and vehicles are a joke. The police too.

I really wonder why the F the first game gets so much hate and the second so much love...

gaming,2015-2016 were such amazing years for game graphics (Examples in desc.),"No real point to this post, I just wanted to talk about how 2015 and 2016 had some amazing looking games in terms of art style. I'm not someone to really care about graphics, but these stuck out to me.

If you have any other examples from around this time period, feel free to point them out in the comments :)

1. Arkham Knight (2015)  
Do I need to elaborate? Honestly it holds up super super well even after almost 10 years. I love how the water looks, the character models, textures, everything.

  
2. Titanfall 2 (2016)

One that I could actually run on my laptop, thanks to the adaptive resolution features. Once I get a better one, I need to play this at max settings, it looks amazing.

3. Dishonored 2 (2016)  
While the first Dishonored holds up well imo, if you look closely the textures have definitely aged. But I can't say the same for the sequel, I just adore the way Dishonored games look.

4. Deus ex: Mankind Divided (2016)  
I think this might be the best looking game on this list.

gaming,"What games excel in romance, whether it be an optional companion romance , or even a canon, main story romance?","The new Dragon Age's romances are really disappointing. It feels like they hardly impact the storyline, and it never feels like you are actually in a relationship with the companion, more like a very close friend for the few scenes the game actually remembers that you romanced a character. 

I've always found that companion romances have been a core part of the Bioware formula, so it's really disappointing to compare Veilguards' romance to the previous  games, namely Dragon Age: Origins.

 The romance questline for Morrigan was a core part of my memories of that game, watching her slowly fall for the player character, and subsequently, change for the better as she found someone that she truly cared for and wanted to be her real self for, dropping the act she was putting on (and would have continued putting on if you didn't engage in her romance questline), overcoming the harsh teachings of her mother that caused her to put up a wall. Choosing to romance her also played a core part in the games main narrative and it really felt impactful, Morrigan became your character's lover, and it mattered in the game world.

I am curious, with the new Bioware failing to live up to old Bioware's pedigree for romance, what games would you say truly excel at delivering romance narratives. I know it's not for everyone, but I personally find that if executed well, a romance subplot can really help elevate a game, making it more memorable and enjoyable to play. 

It could be a game that excels in romancing companion characters, or even a linear, main story romance that is done well.",gaming,285,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gj2bp7/what_games_excel_in_romance_whether_it_be_an/,2024-11-04 00:58:28

gaming,"Games with Unlabeled/Unrequested ""Quests?"" ","
So I've always been a huge fan of the concept where just talking to NPCs can reveal a trouble they have, and then you can resolve it if you so happen to stumble upon a solution or answer for them, without the game ever actually acknowledging it as a quest. 

As an example, I'm currently playing Black Sigil and there is a guard who lost track of some kids he's supposed to be babysitting, but he just says this as an idle complaint, not asking you to do anything about it. If you see and talk to the kids, you can come back and tell the guard (and he just kind of snaps at you, but that's beside the point).

I believe Radiant Historia had side quests similar to this too, where you might not always know if it's a quest or just flavor text because the game doesn't explicitly tell you. 

What are some other games that have a lot of these types of interactions? Any system is fine.

Project Zomboid is nice, but it takes millions of years to get a base going. I must have played that game for about 100 hours and still was never able to get a self-sustained base.",gaming,673,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gift8m/are_there_any_zombie_apocalypse_games_where_you/,2024-11-03 05:16:10

gaming,At an impasse - Several retro gaming options and I'm stuck in a mental loop about which direction to go.,"For the mods: I own and possess original carts for the games I'm about to discuss. I dumped the carts using a cart dumper I purchased and am in full compliance with applicable law. If you need a photo of all of my carts I'll be happy to send you several.

\--------

I've been on a binge lately and started tinkering with several devices I own that could be used for retro game emulation. It's been fun, and I've landed in a place where I'm trying to figure out what the best direction forward is for my own daily use. I'm hoping to elicit diverse feedback to try and find points of view or angles I hadn't been considering. Being stuck in this mental loop sucks! Thanks in advance.

I have an original Gameboy Pocket, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, a few DS's, a PSP, and a Sega Game Gear that I've been restoring, maintaining, and upgrading over the years. I collect physical carts for game series like Pokemon, Monster Hunter, etc. It's a fun hobby and a satisfying experience looking at genuine original retro equipment and games. I really like it. The Pocket and Game Gear are from my childhood and I'm proud to have been their only owner. The rest I've collected over time.

When the Analogue Pocket launched I, of course, picked one up. Love it. It combined four systems I have games for into one.

Unfortunately, something I wasn't aware of with the Pocket was the issue of engaging sleep with games that use RTCs. When the Pocket sleeps it takes a save state and, when the Pocket wakes up, it restores that save state to resume play. This has the side effect of reverting time in any game you're playing back to the time when you slept the Pocket. It sounds obvious hearing it out loud but at the time I wasn't aware of that. An example of this being a problem is Pokemon Crystal.

This sent me down a week-long path of shenanigans of seeing what options there are for me to best have a consistent experience with my games. Right now I'm playing through Pokemon, having completed the Pokedex's of Red, Blue, and Yellow, and now jumping into Gen 2 with Crystal (out of order but such that it is - Crystal is fantastic). I play mostly before bed, but I also sneak in sessions in places like the checkout line of the supermarket, or between calls and meetings at work. I don't surf my phone when I'm on the porcelain throne, I pop open (formerly) my Analogue Pocket and play. Portability, but more specifically pocketability, is a key factor for me.

That said, I dusted off my New 3DS XL, converted my cart dumps to CIA files to install on the device, and now have all of my core games on there. They all play great. It fits in my pocket just fine. All of my dumps I patched to support autosleep when I close the lid, and most importantly, RTC works correctly through sleeping.

I own an Ayaneo Slide and a gaming desktop, so I took all my dumped carts and downloaded all off the relevant emulators (I prefer one program that does one thing well over something like Retroarch that does everything). I set it up with Playnite for a launcher, added all my roms with options for ""Launch Fullscreen"" or ""Launch Windowed"", and added some sick artwork to each game's page. Best of all, I set it all up to sync through Syncthing, so if I play on my desktop, when I pick up my Slide everything syncs over automagically and vice versa. Same for my laptop if I choose it. In this way I can emulate everything all the way up to the most modern Japanese portable handheld perfectly fine.

The downside is the Slide is NOT pocketable. Not by a long shot. If I always wore hoodies then maybe I could make the argument but I don't. I wear pants and the Slide won't fit in my pants pockets. Can I live with that? I dunno. Breaking something out to play when I have a few minutes is just kinda my thing. I don't know if the pros outweigh the cons here. Battery life will perpetually be an issue, and that's also kind of a big deal.

Lastly, I did get all of the relevant emulators running on my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and maaaaaan is that slick. BUT, touchscreen controls don't feel great. It's pocketable (by function), emulates everything perfectly fine and performantly, has great battery life, but the only phone controller I have is the Kish V2 and when I use that I have to take the case off my phone, and then the phone is upside down -- the fold opens downward. A minor annoyance, admittedly, but it would suck to have to carry around a controller or otherwise stick to touch controls when I'm out and about.

So that's where I'm at today --

Native Hardware Pros: Native, very pocketable, AA's last an okay amount of time, feels good in the hands. Cons: I have to carry around carts, and I have to boot the game/device every time I play, which is wasted time.

Analogue Pocket Pros: Plays four whole systems I own and play, battery life is great, it's pocketable, and games can be slept as long as they aren't RTC-based games. Cons: RTC games are broken unless I fully exit them every time, which brings me back to time wasted booting every time. Also have to carry around carts, though I can dump everything to the microSD card.

Ayaneo Slide Pros: Slick as hell, syncs across all of my devices, so I can pick up and play on my TV, handheld, laptop, wherever. Can emulate all the things perfectly. Cons: Not at all pocketable. Poor battery life at best unless I'm emulating the oldest of games. High damage risk due to the size and weight.

New 3DS XL Pros: Slips right into my pocket, plays everything up to the 3DS games itself. Sleep works across all games, and RTC works through sleep. 3D screen that's unique to the device itself. Cons: I'd have to carry around a Switch to play those games. Not a big deal, I do have a Switch Lite, but it's a two-device setup instead of the ideal one-device setup.

\----------------

Since I know when I'll be playing retro games and when I'll be playing modern games I feel like the option that makes the most sense is the 3DS. I can mod it with an HDMI Out port for ""docked"" play since I've been enjoying gaming on the big screen ever since the Analogue Pocket launched, and I can probably 3D print a dock the 3DS can just drop into to charge and play on a TV. The 'options' I get with the PC are obviously technically superior, but fall outside of my normal use case. Lastly, I'm not gaining anything with the Analogue Pocket or original hardware that I wouldn't have with the 3DS, at least that I'm aware of.

Looking forward to some thoughts. Sorry this was long, but it kind of had to be. To pose the question proper, what caveats do you see in any of these options that I don't, and what would you go with given these options and why? Are there options I'm not considering?

gaming,"Understanding Remasters, Remakes, Reboots, and More: A Simple Guide","I’ve noticed people using terms like *remaster*, *remake*, *reboot*, and others pretty loosely, so I thought it’d be fun to try breaking them down with a few examples. This isn’t definitive, just a way to explore how differently games evolve over time. Would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions!

**Enhanced Edition**  
Minor upgrades for compatibility with modern hardware, typically with improved assets or quality-of-life changes, while staying close to the original.

*Examples:* *Quake Enhanced*, *Baldur’s Gate Enhanced Edition*, *Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition*

**Remaster**  
Improved visuals, audio, and minor tweaks, usually using the same game code, preserving the original experience for newer platforms or celebrating a legacy.

*Examples:* *The Last of Us Remastered*, *Dark Souls Remastered*, *Wind Waker HD*, *Skyrim: Special Edition*

**Remake**  
A faithful recreation that keeps core characters and story but is rebuilt with modern graphics and gameplay, aiming to feel like a fresh version of the original.

*Examples:* *Resident Evil 2* (2019), *Shadow of the Colossus* (PS4), *Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Demon Souls*

**Reimagining**  
A retelling that reworks the original story and gameplay with significant changes, while still drawing from the source for a familiar yet fresh experience.

*Examples:* *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*, *XCOM: Enemy Unknown*, *Metroid: Samus Returns*, *Ratchet & Clank* (2016)

**Reboot**  
A fresh start for a franchise that resets continuity and offers a clean slate, often with new stories or reinterpreted lore.

*Examples:* *DOOM* (2016), *Tomb Raider* (2013), *Mortal Kombat* (2011), *DmC: Devil May Cry*

**Retelling**  
An adaptation that reinterprets a story from another medium (like a book or movie) in game form, introducing new elements or perspectives and taking creative liberties.

*Examples:* *The Witcher* (based on the novels), *Jurassic Park: The Game*, *Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*

**Spiritual Successor**  
A new game inspired by a previous title, capturing similar themes or mechanics but existing as a standalone experience.

*Examples:* *Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night* (spiritual successor to *Castlevania*), *Yooka-Laylee* (*Banjo-Kazooie*), *Outer Worlds* (*Fallout: New Vegas*)

Quincy a true music legend whose work changed the game in so many ways. Quincy was the genius behind Michael Jackson's *Off the Wall*, *Thriller*, and *Bad*, mixing pop, funk, and R&B into a sound that’s still mind-blowing. But that's just one part of his story. He worked with icons like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Frank Sinatra, and his 1989 Grammy-winning album *Back on the Block* showed off his insane versatility across genres.  
With 28 Grammy wins (and 80 nominations!), Quincy wasn’t just a musical powerhouse—he was also a cultural force. He co-produced *We Are the World* to help fight famine in Africa, and he founded the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation to support kids' education worldwide.

Some fun facts you might not know:

* Quincy’s fluent in French and Italian and studied in Paris with the amazing composer Nadia Boulanger.
* He met Ray Charles as a teen, sparking a lifelong friendship.
* He even helped bring *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* to NBC, launching Will Smith’s career.
* Surviving a brain aneurysm at 27, he shifted gears from performing to producing—thankfully for us, because he left a lasting mark on music.

Quincy’s influence is everywhere. hit play on your favorite Quincy tracks or stories and big love to a guy who brought so much joy to music.",Music,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gk92c1/celebrating_quincy_jones/,2024-11-05 15:18:48

I really don’t know how to explain it.. i think that definitely contributes to how the song makes me feel. & when she says “where do the good boys go to hide away hide away, I’m a good, good girl who needs a little company..” it literally gives me shivers…

Let me introduce myself, I'm ""Aku"" well, I'm not someone who uses Reddit regularly, but I'd like some help from someone, for several years I've been looking for a music video for an anime called ""Cutie Honey Universe"" and the video for the song I'm looking for is ""Over Heat, Over Heart"" I've listened to the songs and they're great, but I found out that there's a music video that I've been wanting to find for these past 6 years, I've searched from Japanese forums to Lost Media communities, but nothing, so hey, if you're someone who likes to search for this kind of stuff, I'd really appreciate your help! :D



If you need some extra information I can give you everything I've collected over the years, although it's obviously not much but I'd like to end this search once and for all haha

It is a thoughtful song and lyric about who you have become, not about who you could be or dream of. It's about who you are and understanding. Again, listen for the Pitz strings, they are fun while not being too self-righteous.

For me, I once had a tape I bought from a band playing in Georgetown, DC, in 1991. The band was called Avogadro's Number - A couple of the songs were called Crazy, and  Blues Traveler.

The cassette ate itself long ago, and I can only remember the song Crazy because I still play it on guitar.

I was wondering, what is a good reddit place to try to find someone who remembers this band, and hopefully has digitized the songs?

Google searching only reveals a bar call Avogadro's number in Ft. Collins, and a contemporary band that played in Vermont a few years back.,

Hello guys, one volunteer organization is in trouble, and we don't know who to send emails for sponsorships and donations anymore, so if you know which companies regularly donate (or you yourself are willing to give :))) feel free to write. We need money so that the association can survive, it would be a shame if the projects were shut down after 6+ years.  It is about the PsiHelp project, which publishes articles on mental health and has the first base of psychotherapists in the Republic of Croatia. In this way, people who are looking for fat can be educated in a simple way. In addition, the association organizes a summer school and movie nights, as well as education with other associations - for example, a presentation at the CROSS conference of medical students.

business,My business partner betrayed me. ,"Hey everyone. I will keep some things a secret because I don’t wanna hurt anyone. I’m 25 and around year and a half ago, me and my best friend went into a business together. We were kinda in the same world of work, and we decided that it would be a great idea if we merge together. Our business was with YouTube, TikTok, and other social media. When we were starting out, I had one client that I was working for, and he had nothing. So, we decided to outsource that client and focus on bringing in more clients. We worked day and night, and after month or two, he got contacted by a guy/friend that he worked with years ago. That guy had a cool business idea and connections, so we decided to take a shot with him, and bring all of our focus to that idea. The deal we had is that my partner and I split 50/50 and then share our part of the profits 50/50 as well. Long story short, we grew the whole thing to the point where we had (my partner and I) around $15k in profits per month. He was slowly trying to pull me out of the meetings with our other partner, and most of the times he would say that there’s no point we both go in that meeting with him every two days. I was fine with that since he would tell me all the important things they talked about. 

Months passed and everything was working fine. We had around 15 people working for us, making a big chunk for such small period of starting a business (within a year) 
Since everything was going fast, I initiated that we sign a contract between us, just in case, and he would agree but whenever I mentioned it, he would go radio silent and ignore my request. I trusted him with my life so I didn’t make a big deal out of it but I still thought it wouldn’t hurt us to sign a deal so we’re both safe and secure. 

This year, I had a major family thing happen to me, and I couldn’t focus on work, so I asked him to take over for a couple of weeks, maybe a month. I even insisted that he picks up all the profits from that period of time. He was more than fine with that but 3 weeks after, when I got back and ready to work, he reached me out two days after with shocking message that he thinks it’s best if we split. Then he continued on that he thinks it’s best if he takes the clients that he know, and that I should do the same. Keep in mind, that the client he brought was bringing us 95% of the revenue, just as our time and effort was put into that client. 

I couldn’t believe it but again… with all that pushing me away from meeting and ignoring the contract thing, it was obvious that he was planning something. 

So, I was pretty much pushed out completely. He even lied to that client and told him that I was the one who quit. 

On top of all of this, they’re holding around $25k of my money inside that company (because some clients were late with paying) and now it’s been 6 months and I still didn’t get the money. 

From other sources, he doesn’t feel remorse, and he doesn’t feel that he should pay me out the money that I was owed because clients still didn’t pay, and he honestly thinks that it’s fair that he takes over the whole thing just because he was the one that had connections with that guy, even though we started with 0. 

I understand my mistakes. I trusted him, we didn’t sign a contract, and I got played in the worst way possible by a person that I trusted my life with but I don’t know how to go forward with this. He left me with nothing, while he enjoys the money that we both spent the last year day and night working for it. It’s just not fair that he enjoys it while I’m here, left with nothing. 

How can I cope with this? How to move forward? I tried to not think about it and build my own empire from 0 all alone but all of this just keeps me depressed. The day didn’t pass that I didn’t think about all this, and I’m just so tired. I just wanna move on and find a way to live with this but again I can’t stop thinking about how he’s enjoying life right now, with a successful business I was a part of. I feel like I have to take a revange on him, even though I’m not that kind of person.

business,Went all in and now I want out of my friends construction business after just 6 months,"In June of this year I joined my friend in his construction business in Park City. 50/50 Partnership doing high end residential remodeling. I worked on a project that he was managing and then he turned a project over to me as a design/build as I have some design experience.

I have continually been asking him to stop using our business account for his personal expenses and he will not change his poor financial habits. The field work he carries out is shockingly bad. I've had to ask him to correct things, then I see him make the same mistake worse or in a completely different way and then I have to put hands on it for a third and final time myself to ensure it's done properly.

Now I don't want him near our finances as he overdrafted 8 times in the business account that we are moving away from, well that we agreed we were, but he still hasn't. And I don't want him near my job site because he is drinking, has a bad attitude and doesn't produce the standard of work we are selling.

I too am financially irresponsible for multiple reasons, like in this case for instance: I got our company credit a total of $27,000 worth of credit cards, something my business partner didn't have access to himself because of poor financial decisions from the past.

After seeing $280 in overdraft fees from the supposed ""dead"" account I'm feeling a gut response to leave this partnership.

I never signed any documents with him, but apparently he set me up as a 50/50 member of his LLC.

Without having signed any documents with the state, but having signed credit card applications as an owner of the business, what are my responsibilities for walking away from this business? To add to the complexity, we are in the middle of a high paying job. The design/build one I mentioned earlier. We still have $100,000 of work and money to collect from that work.

How can I control that money in a healthy way to make sure he doesn't do something irresponsible with it? I set up the newer bank account as the primary holder. This is a friend and someone I care about. What's my best way out of this?

business,November Marketing Strategy That I Use For 7-Figure Ecom Brands,"The most lucrative month in e-commerce starts now. There is no greater time than now to double down on marketing. Hopefully, this post inspires you to try something new with your marketing this Q4. In this post, I will simply break down what I did to push 1.2 million in sales with emails and SMS last November.

Before I get into the good parts of this post here's a quick disclaimer:

\- The 1.2 million that I am referring to in the first part of this post comes from 2 brands that I do not own. However, the 1.2m is from sales that are directly attributed to the marketing channels that I manage.

\- The marketing structures that I used for both brands are almost identical. This is why I grouped them together for the sake of this post

\- Ads were running on these sites while all of these emails were going out.

\-  If you’re currently doing less than 15k/month, I’d recommend putting less effort into the things I speak about below and putting more effort into things like media buying, social media growth, influencer campaigns, etc. In a nutshell, what you probably need is more front-end traffic. But don't ignore your email marketing channel, it's the easiest 30% revenue boost you will ever get.

Another disclaimer: This post has a large focus on backend marketing. If I wrote about what was happening in the front end with ads, influencers, and promotions, this post would go from a quick read to a short novel. With that being said, I'd still be happy to break the front-end stuff down in another post.

*How I run effective Email and SMS marketing in November*

**Week 1** \- *This is the ramp-up week*. You want to change your marketing from friendly and informational to cut-throat and urgent. The first thing I do is create a new email/SMS pop-out for the brands. Keep the text simple, something like “Do you want 10%? – subscribe to our mailing list for exclusive Black Friday Deals” works better than more wordy pop-outs. Next, I update the automated flows, I add timers (This can be done easily using sites like Sendtric for HTML timers) to the abandoned cart emails and add a BFCM month banner to all of the emails. This adds urgency and makes them feel like they are getting a good deal regardless of when they buy during the month. You can also butter up VIP customers with an early access sale at this time. It’s also a really good idea to add a free gift to orders during this week, it doesn’t have to be big. You just want to be in your customers' good books if you want to convert these guys twice in a 30-day period.

**Week 2** \- *This is the inspiration week*. The goal of this week is to get customers to visualize receiving your product(s). Pick out the products that you want to push and embed them into an email that put customers in a buying mood. Here are some examples, “Best Christmas Gift Ideas” (followed with reviews that showcase people holding the product by festive decorations), Black Friday Favorites (followed with some type of scarcity like “these products fly off our shelves every year around this time, secure yours before we sell out”), or some type seasonal blog post style email which features a use case for your product at this specific time of year (Ex. Baking niche- holiday recipe, Pet niche – “My dog became the star of my Christmas party” followed with a stupid story, Fitness Niche- “5 ways to stay lean during the holidays”, etc.) If you have a large American customer base, this is also a good time to send out a Veterans Day email.

**Week 3** – *This is the week to build hype*. If you want to do a promo, now is a good time to do a free shipping promo in an email that talks about stock being low on Best-sellers. Make it seem like there is an opportunity to buy things at full price with free shipping. Customers should feel like if they don’t buy now, they might not be able to get it at all. At this point, you should have generated 30-40% of the sales that you will generate in the month of November.

**Week 4** – *This is where shit gets crazy*. Let customers know that Cyber Week is here and there will be no better time to buy from your site. I like to run 1 product promos all week, these promos do very well on SMS channels as well. Do an aggressive discount on different products multiple times this week. Make sure there's a short time window to be able to get the discount. This keeps customers on their toes and it builds anticipation. People will be waiting for the item that they’ve been eyeing to go on sale. Avoid heavily discounting your best sellers at this time. I like to send 2 versions of a Happy Thanksgiving email. Version 1 is just a general happy Thanksgiving email that goes out to people who haven’t made a purchase on your site. Version 2 is Happy Thanksgiving + early access to the Black Friday Sale. (If your email list is under 15k I’d suggest sending this to all buyers, If your email list is larger than 15k I’d suggest sending this to people who have purchased 2 or more times)

**BFCM-** Black Friday and Cyber Monday are really just 5 emails and 2 SMS campaigns. Email 1 – Black Friday Sale Announcement, Email 2 – Last chance to redeem Black Friday Sale, Email 3 Cyber Monday Sale, Email 4 – Last chance to get Cyber Monday deal, Email 5 (optional) – Cyber Week Sale. When I run sales for Black Friday, I focus on bulk discounting (ex. Save $50 on orders over $200). Try to at least double your average order value. I focus on convincing the people with the extra funds to spend as much as possible during this weekend. Cyber Monday is for everyone else who may just want 1 or 2 specific things at a better rate. I've found that it is extremely hard to get people to place huge orders after they’ve already bought the things that they really want. This is why I always do bulk discounting first.

Bonus- *This email is often the most profitable email of the entire year.* After all the sales are done, write a plain text “Thank you” email from the “CEO”. I made a whole post about why this email has the potential to be the most lucrative email of the entire year. If done correctly this email will EASILY outperform any of the sales emails you sent during November. 350k of the 1.2 million I mentioned earlier came from this 1 email.

Email and SMS Revenue Breakdown

Brand 1:

Email Revenue: 332k

SMS Revenue: 56k

Brand 2

Email Revenue: 667k

SMS Revenue: 140k



During November, it is very possible to do over half of your sales from existing customers. Around this time of year media buying becomes more competitive. If you have an existing customer base, doubling down on the backend stuff will be more profitable than looking to acquire new customers at this time of year.

business,(RFP) Request for proposal template for your business,"A document issued by a business or an organization to request vendor bids for products, solutions and services.

The RFP process includes three steps:

* Issuing the RFP
* Collecting proposals
* Selecting a winner

Template of RFP:

1. Define the project and its needs
2. Title of the proposal
3. Description of the company
4. Project’s Name
5. Schedule of proposal
6. Project’s overview
7. Project’s requirements
8. Scope of work
9. Associated risk
10. Selection criteria
11. Submission requirements
12. Contact information
13. Timelines

The goal of the RFP process is to define a challenge and then find the right vendor to meet that need. Finding the right vendor means focusing on more than just price. RFPs allow buyers to create a complex side-by-side vendor comparison of important factors. For instance, the RFP may ask about reliability, experience, quality, policies and security.

RFP process consists of nine simple steps:

1. **Brainstorm your needs**

First, the RFP team, led by the procurement manager, must come together to decide exactly what they’re looking for. Indeed, stakeholders, end-users, IT, finance, and any other teams who will be impacted by the procurement decision are involved in the initial requirements gathering process.

Together, they should define the RFP, meaning the challenge they want to overcome or goal they want to achieve, as well as what success will look like. In addition, they must help create RFP questions, establish scope and prioritize selection criteria.

2. **Create a meaningful RFP**

Next, it’s time to write the RFP. If possible, it is helpful to start with an RFP template and customize it. Don’t forget to follow best practices and include questions that speak to your specific needs and situation. For example, these questions can be adapted to almost any procurement project.

* Who are your competitors? Asking this question can help issuers determine a vendor’s integrity. It lets issuers know whether the vendors are honest about who their competitors are and why they lose to them. It can also help issuers determine if there are other options they should explore.
* What is your implementation process like? When purchasing software, including customer success questions is key. RFP issuers should determine how long the onboarding process will take. In addition, explore available support and self-service options.
* What kind of training do you offer? The more complex the solution, the more important this question is. If you don’t understand how to use all the solution’s features and functionality, you may miss out on key benefits. RFP issuers should inquire about the scope of training vendors offer, as well as available formats.
* Can you provide references, reviews or case studies? Certainly, there’s no better way to determine the effectiveness of a solution than by learning about the experiences of those who already use it.

Asking the right questions gives your RFP meaning and ensures you’ll have the information you need to make a confident decision.

3. **Invite vendors to respond**

Now that you have your RFP written, it’s time to gather vendor proposals. In most cases, you’ll develop a list of vendors and ask them for responses directly, but some organizations also use bid services that post their RFPs publicly. This option can increase your responses, but it will likely lead to several irrelevant responses. Consequently, you’ll invest more time in scoring.

4. **Evaluate the proposals**

Once you’ve gathered vendor responses, you’ll want to score their answers. We recommend taking a weighted scoring approach to help prioritize your decision factors. Weighted scoring establishes point values for sections and individual questions in the RFP based on their importance. This allows you to objectively determine which vendor truly best fits your needs.

5. **Select your shortlist**

Based on your initial proposal evaluation, you can create a vendor shortlist — a list of five or so vendors who you will move on to the final stages of the RFP process. All the vendors in your shortlist should be serious contenders that you can picture your organization partnering with. Ask these RFP finalists clarifying questions or request an RFP presentation to help you make your final decision..

6. **Negotiate**

This is the stage where you ensure your organization is getting the best deal possible. Is there a vendor on your shortlist that would be well ahead of the rest of the pack if they just came down on price? Let them know. Most vendors will be happy to negotiate a bit — especially if they know how close you are to a purchasing decision. Remember, be as transparent as possible with your expectations and let the vendor know what potentially winning the RFP means for them.

7. **Make your final selection**

Now to the fun part: Making your actual selection. Make sure to inform the vendor you’ve selected, as well as the vendors you didn’t. Remember to be respectful and consider offering feedback. Just because you didn’t select a vendor today doesn’t mean they won’t be a viable option for your organization in the future.

8. **Sign the contract**

It’s time to make it official. Be sure to have a lawyer review all contract language before you sign anything. You want to make sure everything is set up according to your expectations.

9. **Ongoing review**

Finally, you’ll want to establish your ongoing vendor evaluation process. We recommend using a supplier scorecard to ensure vendors meet your needs. This approach ensures vendors deliver the return on investment (ROI) and results you want to achieve. Make sure to let the vendor know about any areas where you feel they’re falling short so they have an opportunity to correct and meet your expectations.

To better understand the process and RFP meaning, it’s important to know other common terms you might encounter.

1. RFx – The term RFx is a stand-in abbreviation that refers collectively to any of the common ‘request-for \_\_\_\_’ documents. For example, requests for information, requests for quotation, requests for qualifications, requests for proposals and so on.
2. RFI – A request for information (RFI) is a document that solicits general information about the solutions and/or services vendors provide. Organizations generally issue an RFI prior to the RFP process.
3. RFQ – Request for qualifications, abbreviated as the acronym RFQ, is a procurement tool often used in construction that focuses on experience and expertise.
4. RFQ – A request for quotation (RFQ) is a document that solicits pricing and payment information. Organizations often use this type of request when they know what type of solution they want and are only evaluating vendors based on price. Note: Some industries, like architecture, engineering and constructions (AEC) define RFQ as a Request of Qualifications. This is entirely different and pricing cannot be included.
5. BRD – A business requirements document (BRD) is a formal document that outlines the goals and expectations an organization hopes to achieve by partnering with a vendor to complete a specific project.
6. FRD – A functional requirements document (FRD) is a formal document that outlines how an organization expects their vendor to help them achieve a strategic business goal.",business,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1gihjcl/rfp_request_for_proposal_template_for_your/,2024-11-03 07:23:42
business,Social media for new business - How to do it right?,"Social media is considered a touchpoint of your business. A touchpoint is where your customers/clients come in contact with your brand. But all social media are build the same.

* For a new business I would recommend starting out with 2 social media platforms. One for product/service showcase and the other one for lead generation. To choose which platforms you should choose you need to look at your competitors in the industry check what are they doing on specific platform and how active are they.
* Next steps is doing an social media audit of your competitors and understand the post types, what's working for them and what's not working. what are the people talking about in the comments. At the end of the audit you need to set a Goal for your social media platforms.
* Goal setting is very important but setting unrealistic goals is not a good move. When your business is new setting up goal to generate 50 leads through social media is a bad goal. But setting of goal of 80 followers and average 10 engagement in your posts is a good goal to set. Whenever you start and your accounts and business is fresh think about Brand awareness, more people should know about you. More reach and engagement is important.
* If possible set up a Social media communication & visual style guide. where you lay down the foundation, how your posts should be, what you will be posting, with whom will you engage, what tone you will be using in your post and even on comments. I will talk about Brand Tone and Voice later. Once you have your guide ready work on social media branding, create a base templates for posts, stories, carousels.
* Now you have your social media platform ready to post, Do not jump and post with excitement. Lay down a good marketing strategy with associated marketing plan & engagement strategy. Now time to create your first content calendar for first two weeks or 4 weeks. Create assets for the all the content needed. You don't need any PAID tools at this time to post. You can use manual posting which companies like Meta, LinkedIn, X etc are offering.
* Plan your content calendar wisely you don't need to push in 5 reels in a week and burn out. Start with combination of 2 reels, 1 post and daily stories.
* The most important part comes now for your account growth, the engagement strategy you need to start engaging with other accounts and their post consistency to get more profile visits and reach for your posts. Don't spam, Dont be Robotic, Less AI & Be more Human.
* DO NOT JUMP INTO PAID ADS for first month.

Hope this helps those who is struggling with starting out with the business social media. Its just a start guide there is more to come.

business,"Denied Finance BS, Next steps","

Hello! So I’m a current high school senior applying to colleges and I’m pretty new to everything. But I’ve recently applied to ASU as an instate student for Business in Finance BS and Financial Planning BA as a second major option initially thinking it’d be easy getting in because of ASUs high acceptance rate, however now learning that wp carey school of business has a 30 percent acceptance rate in their BS majors 

Then I received an email stating I was admitted into ASU but put into business BA instead, and upon rexamming the admission information 

“ Students who are not admissible to a W. P. Carey business BS major and who did not select a second major or are not admissible to their second major choice are placed in a business Bachelor of Arts program in the W. P. Carey School of Business.” 

Clairfys this, however I’m now wondering how come I was declined?

Im thinking it’s becuase I’m a bare minimum student and the only admission requirement that I actually fulfill in is my GPA. Being a 3.36 unweighted but a 3.7 weighted (however a 3.5 in competency courses thus hitting the mark) though I lack in every other area, (no extracirculars also) 

So my question is, dispite being initially declined from pursing finance BS my first year as an undergraduate. If I do well enough in business BA could I apply for a transfer to BS? I’ve done some research and this seems to be my best option but could I get some more elaboration please? Is there any downsides in this for the long run? And what major should I be pursuing in the mean time to make the transition smoother? 

As for now, I’ve submitted a email to the school with an unofficial transcript attached hoping they’d reconsider me into the major though I feel that’s an unlikely chance of happening. ",business,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1gihaf2/denied_finance_bs_next_steps/,2024-11-03 07:04:18

business,I need help understanding the laws regarding credit card and private information collection in a business environment ,"
I need advice and understanding when it comes to the laws surrounding protecting people’s private information like credit cards, SSN’s etc. I’m pretty certain the place I work is breaking a few difference laws but would like to understand the laws clearly and who is report them to if they are in violation of the law. 
I work at a place the sells home security systems, it’s an inside sales company who calls people and sells them a system and where I see the potential crime or breaking of the law is the sales reps collect peoples SSN and CC over the phone and write them down on paper on just a basic template to collect the info. They then input that information into the computer and into the system. The problems are this. 
1. The paper copy does not get destroyed or shredded, hundreds of these physical sheets are floating around the office at people’s desk and basic Manila folders for anyone to just grab, take pictures of or steal or make copies of and they would have someone’s- full name, address, birthday, social security number and credit card info. Anyone could scoop these up take pictures or copies of them and sell them on the internet or open up cc in their name etc. 
2- they get entered into the system but they are not encrypted or hashed or blanked out with **** or anything. To add to it, everyone has the same password to log into their computer and their login information is posted at their cubicle so anyone like a cleaning person could come in at night, login and download and send themselves hundreds if not thousands of peoples full personal private information. There is no over watch, no security and access to the building is open and into the office space. No security badges no ID pads nothing. I could at any point if I was a disgruntled employee go around the office and collect them and make copies or pictures and I’d have thousands of people information to commit identity theft very easily. 
3- They will charge people credit cards sometimes before people even sign the service agreement

I am almost certain they are breaking FTC rules, credit card standardizing rules like HIPPA but for credit cards and private info. If anyone can help me with this and what laws are being broken and who you’d report this to I’d appreciate the help!

business,Why Are Corporations Owned By Layers of LLCs?,"I was reading the court papers of a lawsuit and found that the defendant company is owned by layers of about 7 LLCs. Each one is the sole member of the last, and so on. Many of them have names very similar to the actual company, some do not. They are all incorporated in Delaware. The last one, at the top, is a huge corporation with tens of billions in annual revenue, in a different state.

Now I know just enough about LLCs to be dangerous. I understand that an LLC serves to isolate the owner company's assets from liabilities that the owned company may have. Maybe they also help reduce taxes. That's about it (the extent of my knowledge).

I’m starting my business as a private consultant and will be driving my car for work often. I am interested in tracking my mileage but I’m quite terrible at remembering to record it using Everlance or MileIq. Furthermore, leaving tracking on automatic drains my phone batteries that I need for the rest of the day.

Has anyone tried buying a cheap $100 phone to leave in your car? My thinking is that the phone is the mileage tracker. Whenever I drive, the phone gets charged. I won’t be more than two days without driving so I see models that reported to have that long of a battery life. 

I did a quick search on Amazon for mileage trackers. All seems to cost the same as the $100 phone except they also have high monthly subscription cost and limited use. Vs me getting a smart phone that I purchase the lowest Google Fi plan for ($10/month) and can use it for phone calls etc.

business,I’m the “zero-to-one launch guy” at my company who does the early GTM for new product offerings and runs marketing and PR — who wants to work with me?,"

I'm a programmer and marketing generalist (web/ SEO/ Content marketing/ Lead gen etc) with experience building and scaling brands. I’m based in the UK and currently work for one of Northern Ireland’s leading B2B software houses where I’ve filled several roles including software developer, web designer and BDM.

 

Some of my accomplishments:

\- Built dozens of start-up brands and managed 100+ websites using just about every CMS and web builder technology out there.

\- Built lead generation systems from the ground up for a real estate/prop tech start-up resulting in $25MM in revenue generated.

\- Participated in the build of a client’s gen AI developer tool and helped grow it to 300K users (businesses and individuals), increasing their top-line revenue by 60% in 9 months.

\- Worked on brand awareness campaigns for fortune 500 brands, including Coca-Cola, Ford, Discovery Channel and NYT, among others.

\- Regularly sold websites for multiple 6-figures ($150k - $600k) for my company to businesses in the 1-5M revenue range.

 

The problem: I’ve outgrown my salary, and I’m bored and not learning anything new. I believe my current employer wants me in a role where they know I’ll just crush every task they give me. I, however, want to be challenged every day, to feel like I’m struggling to keep my head above water, to be somewhere I can keep learning.

I’m running a glorified smma agency - helping small business owners with web presence, seo, social media, and marketing and sprinkling in ai and automation. I have one solid client at $500/mo and I’ve gotten some bigger projects under my belt - $5k, $1.5k, $2.5k, $1.4k etc. but it’s feast or famine. I’m having a hard time getting clients to agree to monthly services. That’s 16.5 over about 1 year of trying (moved twice during that time and I’m a mom of 3, youngest just recently started going to daycare more frequently but still part time).  I’ve gotten to pitch to some big corporations recently on ai consulting, but that’s a long cycle, was approved for a student association for ai in my mba program (global program), and I’m revamping my networking strategy. My clients refer people to me, but also that’s slower growth, and they send the people my info instead of connecting me. Totally dependent upon the person. Also reconsidering my marketing strategy and doing more affiliate marketing showcasing of tools, “built this business with ai from scratch” sort of videos, etc. To the point though - finances really hurt right now. Thankfully my husband is able to cover our needs, but I can’t keep justifying working on this at 16.5k from a year. Can I? One of my clients attributes a lot of his success to the consulting and work I have done for him and we’ve been in business the same amount of time. He’s now at 6 figures. 🫠 Am I being dumb? I’m considering taking what I know about marketing and applying it to another industry, like power washing, cleaning, hvac, construction supply sales, or something else, and finding a part-owner operator to work with me on it. Maybe even ask that client for help to transition. I have a part time job interview coming up on the 6th that would help alleviate the strain I feel and it’s in a consulting space I’m excited about. But I have 3 steps left to go in the process including this interview. I’m also doing market research for two business models and I’m connected to a community in my city that could help me find a job but they’re unlikely to become my clients. 

One more thing to note is that my husband is supportive, but pointed out he feels like I’m working a lot for so little and not being around people (working remotely) seems like it’s adding to stress I feel emotionally/ socially.

business,How do you handle business continuity when opening a remote office?,"I work for a somewhat large company, a few thousand employees around the world, some larger offices (NY HQ is about 500 people, Boston office has about 65, some only have 8 or 9 depending on the workload... we need to be close to our customers)


We are trying to tackle a problem with IT - the issuing and collecting of laptops. We've been behind with laptop refreshes since Covid and haven't caught up. It's normally the task of the techs, but they are busy enough and we never get caught up.

One of the best potential solutions we've targeted would be to rent some office space, and hire a couple junior IT techs. The nature of this job would be to essentially warehouse laptops. New laptops would be delivered there, these employees would be responsible for setting them up for new hires or refreshes, mailing them out, and receiving laptops from leavers/old laptops from refreshes, and doing what needs to be done with them.

As this role falls squarely under the role of a particular IT manager who happens to be 100% remote, in an area that's quite inexpensive to rent, the thought is to open a small IT-only branch there to serve this purpose. He would be able to pop in regularly (one of the things he misses from going remote was being a leader and having techs under him, so he's fully onboard and is actually driving this conversation) to give guidance, ensure the job is being done right, etc.

The issue that I'm facing: What if this manager decides to leave?  How would we ensure that the office would manage to maintain it's functionality? The full-time employees there would be pretty low level so I'm not sure if it's something we'd be comfortable being self sufficient.

We do have an actual office about 2.5 hours away. Maybe hire the replacement with the stipulation this office needs to visited on a regular basis? Close the office and relocate operations to the (somewhat) nearby office and ask the employees to relocate?

We aren't an org that views layoffs as a viable option for stuff like this.


Hoping for some ideas on business continuity.. my skills are in IT, not running a business, so hoping to get some thoughts from people who have done this, or might have more experience than I in this realm.

business,Does my selling proposition make sense?,"Hi, I’m super new when it comes to businesses, I'm trying to open a design agency in my country. I have been a digital designer freelancer. for more than 7 years and I have experience in Web Design, Graphic Design, 3D, even Social Media. I’m curious about some things because I want to understand if my business can have success or not. 



I want to sell packages like Branding, Websites, Social Media etc, my main service would be websites, mostly done in webflow, framer and full code based. In my country for example, most of the agencies do mostly wordpress websites where they buy a theme, change some texts, images, etc and that’s the website. For some reason I saw that’s enough for most of the clients. Recently I even saw my gf’s boss paying about 15k euros for a wordpress website and some intagram posts. For you would it make sense to pay for websites that are custom, higher quality, but cost more and take more time to create?

business,I got a opportunity i wanted for a long time but my family is against it whats should i do?,"I am 18 and have always been into business not the Instagram one, since birth i have had various hobbies related to money,  Like maintaining my piggy bank etc,  So I've been waiting for an opportunity as my family is broke and would not be able to support me financially in business start ups or anything similar,  I went to this cafe it was a good idea with good branding they had some books to read which were from the owner multiple business books filled with notes and stuff it was clear this person is a hard worker and considering he has a business running i wanted to meet him and get a job just to learn business from him somehow i talked to the manager and got a chance it seems like i could possibly get this job and i wanted this for a long time.

 My previous accounts teacher told me his story about how he got a degree in hotel management and worked in a small restaurant to get experience, now he is rich and teaches students as a hobby,  I talked to my brother about this he said i should focus on studying for now instead of doing this and he said it would be impossible to manage guitar studies and work together,  I personally do trading in the morning and i could replace that time to get this job and do part time i have time on me but he wouldn't agree and says to get my grades up. 

I absolutely despise india's education system it's way too bookish and impractical for me and i would prefer to get hands on education as much as i can I'd prefer to take a risk and get the life i want instead of the one he or my family thinks i should have i wanna get independent as soon as i can without rushing it he wants me to wait till 25 to even get a pacheck,  I think he is right about getting a degree but if i get back from work at 3pm and study for even 2-3 hours i think it would be enough, after studying i would have 5-6 hours left and i could practice guitar in that time period however long i want i rarely sleep in evening so that's not a problem i can even wake up early to squeeze out more time to maintain my health or study 

Am i being irreasonalble?

I know I need to pay FUTA...I finally crossed the $500 threshold to make a deposit on it. I know you can pay/make the deposit through the EFTPS system. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to do this.

I have an EFTPS account, and I have been using it to pay the other payroll stuff (federal income tax, social security, medicare) using Form 941.

I have browsed through the available forms on the EFTPS and the only thing I am finding is the annual unemployment tax return (Form 940). I looked through the FAQ on the EFTPS site. I have tried Googling it, and I find everything FUTA...like how to calculate, when to pay, etc...but NOT how to make the deposit on EFTPS. I have tried searching tutorials on Youtube (that's how I figured out how to correctly file the other withholding stuff), and again get the same thing...people explaining what FUTA is, what income is used to calculate (first $7,000 employee makes), when to pay (after hitting $500 threshold, unless it's end of Q4)...but NO walk throughs of making the deposit on EFTPS, or telling you how to do so.

So, I just need help figuring out how to make the deposit for FUTA on the EFTPS site. Any and all help would be appreciated. I feel like I am losing what's left of my sanity to figure this out. I also don't feel like giving my money to the IRS should be this hard to figure out.",business,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1gg0cm9/how_to_deposit_futa_on_eftps/,2024-10-30 23:19:11

food,[Text] Have you ever tried Càrnyog?,"Have you ever tried carnyog? Here is some info abt it i'd love to find out who has tried it and where they are from!

# Description

Carnyog in a Bowl

[Càrnyog](https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/C%C3%A0rnyog) is a Dessert made from a combination of Greek Yoghurt and Hazelnut Spread, however it also can be created using Chocolate sauce and normal yoghurt or other mixes however for a more original taste Greek Yoghurt and Nutella/Hazelnut Spread should be used. The dish can also be served with Fruits such as Strawberries or Bananas

[ Càrnyog in a bowl](https://preview.redd.it/bqvvqjnab5zd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f78cbe367ec9598ac1a5bab75483e10d9c936bc)

The dish's origins are likely from [Northern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England) specifically the North east during the 19th century however it is eaten across Northern England. The name comes from the Scots Gaelic root of 'Càrn' meaning to come from the Earth referring to nuts/hazelnuts and cocoa and yogh from the simplified english of Yoghurt.

# Ingredients

* Greek Yoghurt or plain [Yoghurt](https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Yoghurt) or Greek Style Yoghurt.
* Any Hazelnut Spread but preferably Nutella
* Fruit (optional)

# Directions

1. Get a bowl and put about 4 tbsp of Greek Yoghurt in the bowl depending on how much yoghurt you want
2. Put around 3 tablespoons of Nutella on top of the Yoghurt and DO NOT mix
3. Add fruits if you want

# How to serve

Serve Càrnyog as it is in the bowl after making make sure to not mix in otherwise the flavours of the Nutella will disappear and you wont get the nice texture from the scoops of Nutella.",food,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1gkgyko/text_have_you_ever_tried_càrnyog/,2024-11-05 20:50:03

history,The Armenian Genocide,"The Armenian Genocide of 1915 stands as a stark departure from the centuries-long treatment of Armenians within the Ottoman Empire. Historically, Armenians were part of the millet system, where religious minorities like Christians and Jews were granted a degree of autonomy under Ottoman Islamic rule. While they were subject to certain legal and social restrictions, such as higher taxes and limitations on political participation, they were generally tolerated and even flourished in urban and economic life. Armenians were often referred to as the “loyal millet” for their perceived loyalty to the Sultan. The coexistence between Muslims and Armenians, while imperfect, was marked by a level of mutual accommodation that allowed Armenians to maintain their religious and cultural practices for centuries within a predominantly Muslim empire.

However, the rise of secular Turkish nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries profoundly altered this dynamic. The Young Turks, particularly after taking power in 1908, promoted a vision of a homogenous Turkish nation that conflicted with the multi-ethnic and multi-religious fabric of the Ottoman Empire. Secularists within the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), who led the empire during World War I, viewed the Armenians as a threat to the territorial integrity of the state, especially given the rise of Armenian nationalist movements and the empire's losses in wars with Christian powers. The decision to expel, massacre, and deport Armenians from Eastern Anatolia was driven more by nationalist and strategic concerns than religious ideology, reflecting a modern secular nationalist vision that saw minorities as expendable in the quest to secure a cohesive Turkish state.

While the leadership of the Ottoman state was responsible for orchestrating the genocide, many individual Muslims resisted these policies and helped Armenians at great personal risk. Stories of Muslim neighbors hiding Armenian families, providing food and shelter, and even aiding their escape are well documented. Some local officials and religious leaders also protested against the massacres, arguing that they violated the core principles of Islamic law, which emphasized the protection of life, even for non-Muslims under Islamic rule. These acts of humanity highlight the disconnect between the secular nationalist agenda of the ruling elite and the traditional Islamic values of coexistence and protection of minority rights.

The Armenian Genocide, therefore, cannot be understood solely through the lens of religious conflict. It was the secular nationalist aspirations of the CUP that transformed long-standing social tensions into a campaign of extermination and expulsion. The assistance provided by Muslims to Armenians during this dark period serves as a powerful reminder that religious solidarity and human compassion often transcended the divisive nationalist ideologies of the time. It also underscores the fact that many within the Ottoman Empire did not support the genocide, and that the brutality was not inherent to the broader Muslim population, but rather a result of a specific political project aimed at reshaping the empire's ethnic and national identity.

Sources;

Taner Akçam, a prominent historian and one of the leading scholars on the Armenian Genocide, whose works such as The Young Turks' Crime Against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire (2012) offer in-depth analysis of the transition from Ottoman multi-ethnic society to the secular, nationalist policies that fueled the genocide.

Donald Bloxham, in The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians (2005), discusses the role of secular nationalism and the modern state apparatus in the orchestration of the genocide, while also noting the complexities of religious and ethnic coexistence in the Ottoman Empire before 1915.

Raymond Kévorkian, in The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History (2011), provides a comprehensive account of the genocide, exploring both the involvement of the Young Turks and the role of individual Muslims who opposed the violence or helped Armenians.

Fatma Müge Göçek, in her book Denial of Violence: Ottoman Past, Turkish Present, and Collective Violence Against the Armenians, 1789-2009 (2015), analyzes the role of secularism and modern nationalism in shaping the policies that led to the Armenian Genocide, as well as the actions of those who resisted such policies.",history,370,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1g2yfv4/the_armenian_genocide/,2024-10-13 20:02:38
history,Are ancient Xianbei (Serbi) in eastern Asia actually Sarmatians by origin?,"Ancient Xianbei (or Serbi) people are well known historical topic.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei

However, there are certain controversies about their origin. In his recent work (2017) with title ""Languages of Ancient Southern Mongolia and North China A Historical-Comparative Study of the Serbi or Xianbei Branch of the Serbi-Mongolic Language Family,with an Analysis of Northeastern Frontier Chinese and Old Tibetan Phonology"" author Andrew Shimunek used name ""Serbi"" for this people, as it is believed to be reconstruction of their original name:  

https://www.google.rs/books/edition/Languages_of_Ancient_Southern_Mongolia_a/V-BjEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbi%E2%80%93Mongolic_languages

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIy9JKVNMGc

According to this article, ancient Chinese texts basically described Xianbei (Serbi) people as Indo-Europeans:

https://www.dandebat.dk/eng-dan14.htm

Furthermore, an genetic analysis of population of the Xiongnu state (which predeced Xianbei / Serbi state) clearly shows an important Sarmatian component in this population:

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xiongnu_ancestry.png

As it is already well known, Serbi were one of the tribes in eastern European Sarmatia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Colchis,_Iberia,_Albania,_and_the_neighbouring_countries_ca_1770.jpg

It is believed by some researchers that part of these Sarmatian Serbi moved to the west, where it was slavicized and gave its name to current people of Serbs and country of Serbia.

However, I have not yet seen some researches where Serbi in eastern Asia are connected to Sarmatians despite the fact that presented data shows possible connection. Xiongnu and Xianbei (Serbi) states in eastern Asia were multiethnic and it is likely that Sarmatians who were known as Xianbei (Serbi) were actually an ruling class in Xianbei (Serbi) state, while Serbi language explained by Shimunek in his book was rather a most common language spoken in this state by Para-Mongolic population, which was ruled by Sarmatian upper class.

history,Manipulation through Masculinity: How Norse Women Used 'Ergi' to Influence Men,"
In Norse society, the concept of 'ergi' - implying unmanliness or effeminacy - was one of the most severe insults a man could face. Interestingly, the sagas provide numerous examples of women weaponizing this concept to manipulate men into action. Let's explore some of these instances:

1. Njáls saga: Hildiglúmr's wife accuses her husband of cowardice to pressure him into avenging their son's death. She essentially questions his manhood, a subtle form of 'ergi' accusation.

2. Laxdæla saga: Guðrún Ósvífrsdóttir goads her brothers into avenging her husband Bolli's death. She tells them, ""It may be that you think more like daughters than sons of Ósvífr if you do not avenge such a brother-in-law as Bolli was."" This comparison to women directly challenges their masculinity.

3. Gísla saga Súrssonar: Þórdís pressures her husband Börkr to avenge her brother Þorgrímr, implying he's less of a man than Gísli if he doesn't act.

4. Völsunga saga: Brynhildr incites Gunnar to kill Sigurðr by suggesting he's not a true man if he allows Sigurðr to live after sleeping with her.

5. Orkneyinga saga: Count Sigurðr's wife urges him to attack the Scots, insinuating cowardice if he refuses.

These examples demonstrate how women in Norse sagas used accusations related to 'ergi' or lack of masculinity to manipulate men, particularly in matters of vengeance or conflict. This tactic allowed women to exert influence in a society where they often had limited direct power.

It's important to note that while these sagas provide valuable insights into Norse culture, they were written down centuries after the events they claim to describe. Therefore, they may reflect 13th-century attitudes as much as or more than those of the Viking Age.

This phenomenon highlights the complex gender dynamics in Norse society and demonstrates how deeply ingrained concepts of masculinity and honor were in their culture. It also shows how women, despite their generally subordinate position, could wield significant influence through manipulation of these cultural norms.

What are your thoughts on this aspect of Norse culture? How do you think this compares to gender dynamics in other medieval societies?

travel,Doubtful Sound - New Zealand,"I got a rental in Christchurch and have been driving around the South Island, so I came up from Invercargill rather than down from Queenstown like most people.  I had the overnight cruise with Real NZ booked, and although I was solo, you still have to pay double occupancy, so it was around $1500 NZD.  In my opinion, though, the experience is well, well worth the money, even if you’re by yourself.  The price also includes lunch and dinner, and the whole thing lasts pretty much 24 hours on the dot.  You actually take a small boat across Lake Manapouri first and then a bus over the pass where the power station is located.  We had good weather the first day, and lousy on the second, but I actually liked the bad weather better!

travel,Luxor (Egypt),"Using a burner account to share my experience.

Past weekend, I decided to travel to Luxor from our holiday in Hurghada with my girlfriend since it was a long time dream of us to visit the capital of ancient Egypt (we're both into history).

To give you an idea on our background, we're both beginning of our 30s and have travelled to about 40+ countries together (North Africa, Latin America, South East Asia etc.). Look wise we're olive skinned Mediterranean (I'm from a Balkan country, she's mixed Spanish/Moroccan), so we're not the typical ""target"" for locals. Additionally, my girlfriend purposefully dresses down to be moderate and not draw attention and I have tall, athletic build.

Both of us have grown up with quite thick skin because of the environment where we were raised, so the poverty, hassling, negotiating prices everywhere you go, getting ripped off, etc. did not really come off as a major shock to us. However, we had an awful encounter regretting our visit to this country. 

**Story time:** During the day, we visited all the different monuments on the East Bank and, beside the usual stuff I read on Reddit happening to tourists in Egypt, nothing more happened. The hotel staff, our driver, the employees at the various tourist sites were all friendly and helpful, so far so good and a great experience for history geeks like us.

After dinner at our hotel's restaurant around 7pm, we decided to take a walk on the boardwalk near the Nile (where all the cruises are anchored). After a nice long walk, we decide to have a drink at a café on the boardwalk. At this point (9pm), there were pretty much only locals outside walking around and/or having a drink. Mostly men, so again the staring, remarks in Arabic, etc. was more than prevalent, but fine, we just ignore it to not spoil our day because there is not end to it, right? When asking for the bill a kid (aged 11-12) from a distance started to blow kisses, hearts, etc. to my girlfriend. Since it was a child, we were thinking nothing more to it than again an example of lack of education and respect which we experienced during our walks in Hurghada on a previous holiday before.

After we paid the bill, we decided to walk home the same way we came, so this same kid starts to haggle us for food, then for a drink, then eventually for money. We ignore it and keep on walking towards our hotel. We had to take a turn on a road where there was limited lighting and only cars passing by, so we kept walking and ignoring him to reach another main road when he suddenly started to run in front of us, picked up a big rock and started to shout aggressively and threatened to throw it on us. Seeing this unfold, my girlfriend panicked because my first reaction was to let go of my girlfriend and walk towards him to fuck him up when she grabbed and pushed me back reminding me that it's a minor and if I hurt him (which I was intending to do, because I was not going to let someone threaten her or me), I might end up in jail if something happens etc. So she calmed me down and urged me to walk back quickly to the boardwalk where we came from to have some people around us. And so we did. He followed us all the way back to the boardwalk, but with the rock hidden in his hoodie. I decided to talk to one of those horse carriage drivers to take us back to the hotel hoping it would solve the issue of crossing the road we need to cross to get to the hotel. All said and done, we arrive at the corner of the street of our hotel and we hop off the carriage. 

Guess what? Suddenly this kid appears again out of nowhere. Most likely he ran and chased the carriage down for nearly 1,5km.

At this point, we told the driver to call the Tourism Police and pointed to the kid out saying he chased us all the way down. The driver (after asking for a tip of course) walked us to the hotel entrance where we immediately went inside to tell the reception what was going on. The kid then walked by the entrance and when seeing that there was a guard in the entrance finally decided to give up and disappeared. Reception said they can call the police, but it would be impossible for the police to find him again since it's dark and nothing ""serious"" happened to us. Basically, it would just be a waste of time to file in a report etc. and advised us not to go walking alone by the evening again. We barely slept that night and left first thing in the morning.

I hope this experience will help anyone considering to visit Egypt to plan their trip like many suggested: **with an experienced, local tour guide who drives you around from point A to B. Do to not go on walks in the late evening by yourself thinking you'll be fine.** The harassment, hassling and uncomfortable feeling of being unsafe is multiplied by 100 when it's dark, even as a couple, so let alone for solo female travelers.",travel,358,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjiwa8/luxor_egypt/,2024-11-04 16:48:23

Days 1-3 Antigua: Adjust to altitude, explore the city. Potentially a day trip to Chichicastenango (we've considered doing this from Atitlan as well)

4-5: Acatenango volcano hike

6-9: Shuttle to and stay around Atitlan. Thinking about splitting 2 nights each in San Pedro and Santa Cruz. Want to hit some of the trails (Indian Nose, Lower Mayan, maybe San Pedro), might take a weaving workshop. Otherwise relax and explore the towns around the lake.

10: Travel all day travel to Lanquin

11-12 Semuc Champey: Probably going to do a tour the first day and self-guided the second.

13: Most of the day will be shuttling to Flores. Still haven't decided if we want to stay in Flores or Tikal.

14 Flores: Spend sunrise at Tikal, explore the ruins

15 Flores/Travel Home: Have half a day or so to spend in Flores/Tikal before we have to fly back to Guatemala City and then home from there.

We're a bit sketchy on the journey to Semuc Champey being worth it, buuuuuuut after trawling dozens of threads of people complaining about the journey being awful and somehow still being worth it, we're getting too much FOMO to not try it.

We're located in Vancouver, BC and we typically go on farther/longer (3 week trips) for our holidays, but next year we're thinking of doing a few shorter ones (within USA).

We've been to a fair number of US cities including most of the ""usual"" ones such as: Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington DC, New York, Miami. 

We like good food (both high end and local/regional ""cheap eats""), history, shopping, being active (in nature or just walking around exploring city streets), watching sports (pro and college), interesting architecture and/or beautiful landscapes - Obviously, we're not expecting one city to tick ALL these boxes, but maybe a combination of a few would be nice. 

Places we've been considering are:

\- New Orleans

\- Savannah/Charleston

\- Boston

 \- Utah ""Mighty 5"" Parks - from SLC or Vegas (this would likely be a 9-10 day trip).

\- Arizona (Phoenix/Sedona/Flagstaff areas).

\- Denver (during summer months)

\- Asheville, NC was on the radar - but not sure how they're doing following the Hurricane...

3) Day at a theme park in Anaheim.. I know it would be busy but we may do 1 day on the way to Palm Springs if the itinerary makes sense.

4) What ""tourist traps"" might be worth a quick detour (I.e. Hollywood sign, Rodeo Dr,

travel,Australia January 2025 trip advice,"Hello, thank you in advance for reading.

I am from the UK, in my mid twenties, have been granted some leave from work and am heading to Australia for the first time between 4th and 23rd January. I am staying with my friend from Brisbane for the first five days, but then have a couple of weeks I'm unsure what to do with.

I'd have loved to visit Whitsundays, but have discovered that it is both rain and stinger season. I've therefore been thinking about WA. In an ideal world I'd perhaps head from Perth to Esperance, but I'd really like to join an 18 - 30s trip, and can't find any for this area. I have, however, found a Gap360 trip from Perth to Exmouth, which sounds fun.

I don't mind the heat (experienced Thailand in April where it was 39 degrees everyday earlier this year - not ideal but fine), I just wondered if I'm going to run into the same problems as with Whitsundays if I head up this way? (E.g. storms and stingers. I appreciate there are loads of flies and it will be hot!)

Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. I would really like to experience Australia outside of the big cities, and as it's my first solo trip the thought of joining a group for part of it really appeals... but almost all 18-30s trips are up the East Coast (where it will be wet).",travel,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkc3n0/australia_january_2025_trip_advice/,2024-11-05 17:26:40
travel,Invited to film festival in India. What visa to ask for?,"So in this sense, nobody is really helpful. The festival directs me to the embassy, the embassy cannot advice what type of visa I need, they have an agency or partner for visas. And then it gets messy and definitely can't see proper information about being invited for three days for a film festival.

Should I just ask for a regular tourist E-Visa? But then are they gonna inquiry much at the customs? Yes, sir, I'm sightseeing for three days after a 20h flight (this doubt is the only reason I don't jump straight away to get this visa now).

I asked the person from the embassy if I should just avoid hassle and get the tourist e-visa and she said it's a personal preference.

Should I ask for a Conference visa or Conference E-Visa? I can´t find anywhere if a film festival qualifies for that.  Conference visa is subjected to scrutiny and security clearance, which seems an overcomplication for a festival where we are gonna talk just about films and entertainment. Also I fear the processing time for this. The festival is sponsored by the government.

All advice is much appreciated.",travel,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gk4f8x/invited_to_film_festival_in_india_what_visa_to/,2024-11-05 11:20:58

travel,Indonesia Itinerary - Sanity Check,"Hi All! We, a couple in our mid 30s, are doing a 20 day trip in Indonesia. It's last minute, end of November and early December. We have our international flights booked, but nothing else. We are flying in and out of Bali (flights were cheapest, we did look at multiple options, including multi-way). We have both been to Bali before, but a long time ago. We are keen to see and do as much as possible but maybe we are taking on too much?

Day 1 - 24hr journey  
  
Day 2 - Arrive 00:30 Denpasar  
  
Day 3 - uluwatu beach and recover from long journey  
  
Day 4 - uluwatu, **maybe do a road trip, or anything else that is not too tiring on one of these days?**  
  
Day 5 - uluwatu,   
  
Day 6 - Travel to Ijen - 4hr bus/1hr ferry/1.5hr taxi! **Maybe break this up by traveling up to near Gilimanuk on day 5? Hotel could arrange pick-up. I know Gilimanuk is not very nice but Banjuwedang looks good?**  
  
Day 7 - Climb Ijen with tour, midnight/1am start! Back at hotel around 8-9am to travel 1.5hrs to catch the 11:00 train to Probowangi, arrive 15:06, 1.5hr journey to Cemoro Lawang, arriving around 5pm! LONG day. We'll probs arrange a taxi to avoid waiting for a mini-bus to fill/avoid all the scams and hassle. I have a couple of quotes and I know it will cost more but we will have had a super long day.  
  
Day 8 - 3am wake up when we're already shattered. **Is this mental?** Sunrise viewpoint, caldera, sea of sands all self-guided. We want to avoid the jeeps and tours in general, **although it seems to make sense for Ijen due to logistics?** After Bromo we have three train options, 11:30am from Probolingo arrives Yog 20:30 on economy train. 15:10 from Probolingo but arrives Yog **22:30** which we want to avoid as that's a very late arrival. Or 14:55 **from Malang** which arrives Yog 20:30. So ideally we would want to get the Malang train as this allows us more time in Bromo but still arrives in Yog around 20:30. It's also an executive train so we could rest better on the train rather than the 11:30 economy from Probolingo. **But it seems all transport to Malang from Cemoro Lawang actually goes on the toll road via / close to Probolingo? Is there no way to get across to Malang from Cemoro Lawang with luggage? Google maps shows it can be done in 2hrs or so but I believe this is not true? Is that because of all the jeeps blocking the road, or the sea of sands/entrance fee? Or the road is not actually a road at all? Is it simply not possible? Anyone know or done this journey? If it is not possible, do you think we could make the 11:30 train from Probolingo if we pre-arranged our transport? How rushed would Bromo be without a tour? Sounds like it is about 3hrs of walking. Maybe do-able with a moped across the sea of sands? Could we get back to be ready to leave the hotel for 9.30am latest?  As out of season, maybe no need to book the train? Then if it all feels too rushed we could just go for the later Probolingo train or even the Malang train?**

Day 9 - arriving late the night before, staying somewhere central in Yog, lie in and do one of Prambanan or Borobudur. Probs do Prambanan as only 30min taxi from central Yog. **Maybe get a 1hr taxi from central hotel to a hotel near Borobudur, that same evening? Means don't need to be up so early the next day for Borobudur, and avoids having to go back to yog before going to the airport?**

Day 10 - Either a short or long taxi to Borobudur depending on where we stay, will likely miss the sunrise but also miss the hoards of people on tour. Taxi to airport for a 17:45 flight to Lombok. **Maybe we should build a rest-day in here and travel to Lombok the following day and take-off a night in Lombok.** I know it's a twat thing to say - wouldn't be if I said I wanted to swim and it's just a sport - but I'm quite keen to play a round of golf in Indonesia and there is a course near Borobudur. 

Day 10-14 - Lombok. Potter around on a Moped (I've read up on IDP/insurance/legalities etc). Waterfalls, beach, maybe golf, recover from all of Java basically. Roads seem good but everywhere is like 1.5hrs driving. **Where best to base ourselves, Senggigi? Or stay on ""secret"" gillis and just veg out? We won't have it in us to climb Rinjani, but could we do a walk with views without full camping trek? Any recommendations?** 

Day 15 - Fly back to Bali and then immediately fly to Labuan Bajo all in same day. Looked at ferry and flight options but can't rely on ferry with island time or rough seas. Flights seem less likely to get cancelled, still, will be a difficult day with maybe 1.5hr taxi to Lombok airport, 1hr flight to Bali, waiting around in airport, 1.5hr flight to LB, 20minute boat or taxi to hotel from LB. Also looked at 4D3N trips to Komodo from Lombok but can't trust this with weather/horror stories and too old to be stuck on a dodgy boat with gap year students and too poor to do it private and premium. 

Day 15-20 Flores. Stay in one place and do the 2D1N Komodo tour. Seems to be best as longer is too long for us trapped on dodgy boat and day trips will be too rushed considering it's like a 3hr journey from LB. I've read the advice about sorting that out there and checking out the boats etc.

Day 20 - fly to Bali to catch a 1am flight. **Is it too risky to take an internal flight on the same day as our international, the flight is not till 1am, so I'm thinking we just don't get the last flight out and then any cancellations we should still be able to get on a later flight? Or should we have one final night in Bali? Maybe stay Sanur?**

I know that travel will take a lot longer than what google maps shows, and even if we pre-book and overpay for private transport there will be lots of delays and maybe even cancellations, especially as it's rainy season. So is what we are attempting crazy? Or is it doable? On a side-note, we also looked at getting somewhere less travelled, like Sumba or Sulawesi or even Raja Ampat but all seemed too logistically difficult/or too expensive, or just not enough going on (?). Ideally we would like to see the big main events like Bromo and Borobudur but also have some relaxation somewhere less crowded / polluted than Bali, but also has good standard hotels/restaurants and things to do, hence why Lombok seemed like a decent bet.   
  
**Maybe we don't book our hotels/internal flights until like 2-3 days before along the way so we can remain flexible? We're out of season. Is that recommended? Prices don't seem to have moved for internal flights and there are lots of hotel options with availability everywhere I have checked. What about trains?** 

Sorry this turned into such an essay and inner monologue, and thank you so much for helping me. 

TLDR, are two night climbs in a row and multiple days of trains planes and automobiles completely mental? Is Bali, Java, Lombok, Flores too much for 20 days?

travel,Colombia Trip Report,"Recently took a trip to Colombia (with a small side quest to Panama).

Thought I'd share some of my opinons, thoughts, my itinerary as well as the costs. I took a late night flight out of London direct to Bogota, but connected to a flight to Cartagena. This was a self-transfer so I left 6 hours between flights to transfer in Bogota, which was also the cheaper option. Turns out my flight landed an hour early (2:30am as opposed to 3:30am) and customs and immigration was super efficient. but I was unable to transfer to the earlier flight at 4am and all other flights had seemingly sold out, so I just had to turtle it out in the airport and try to nap. The domestic gates are not ideal for napping, as there are some very loud announcements, though I did find a quiet corner in some gates downstairs. Theres ample water fountains and wi-fi so it turned out OK in the end.

**Cartagena - 2 Days**  
**Day 1** \- This was my first stop, dropping my bags at the hotel at 11AM, I was straight off to the city to explore. Walking around, I explored the old town, the Baluarte de Santo Domingo, City Walls and soaked in the atmosphere in some of the Plazas. Tried some Lechon which was delicious for lunch.  
**Day 2** \- I checked out Fuerte San Felipe de Barajas, then once again went back to the old town to soak in the atmosphere and walk around. 

[Baluarte de Santo Domingo](https://preview.redd.it/1orsod3pmxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46b37c04b5f79328e27a6e628e0bd48b1701faf7)

There is not much else to do here unless you're into nightlife (which I am not) or checking out some of the beautiful islands (which I do not have money to do). There was a great lively atmosphere and I understand why lots of people come here for the nightlife, though I was happy to only spend 2 days here.

**Medellin - 4 Days**  
**Day 3** \- I took an early AM flight out of CTG to MDE - I was able to roll out of bed about 90 mins before the flight as my hotel was on the airports doorstep. Arriving into Medellin, I took a bus to the city, getting dropped off behind San Diego Mall. A 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station I was able to buy my transit pass and make my way to my Hotel. Dropping off my bags, I went exploring again. Though first I had a classic Bandeja Paisa. This kind of reminded me of the much loved Full English Breakfast in the UK, so I really enjoyed it. I then checked out Museo El Castillo and Santafe Mall. I'm not typically someone who goes to malls but it was interesting seeing the sort of stores they had, and also found a great place to get Paletas in the mall. I made my way back up to my hotel, grabbing some Empanadas for dinner.

**Day 4 -** I went to Pueblito Paisa, which was an interesting first panoramic view of the city, though the ""Pueblito"" itself was fairly basic and had some replicas of old colonial style buildings. I then went to Comuna13, which was fun to see - it was vibrant and loud and interesting to make my way up as high as I could. I found a quiet spot deeper into the Comuna and watched the sunset and lights turn on over the city - it was a beautiful view. After this, I made my way all the way back down, then made the journey to another view point. This required a cable car then about half hour hike through some fairly dodgy neighbourhoods. Once I got to the viewpoint though, it was all worth it, the view was stunning.

[Comuna 13 View](https://preview.redd.it/kmf970zlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b1af3f53cfbb9602fdf2d64c9f323ee40e3be34)

**Day 5** \- I'd heard a lot about Parque Arvi, and as someone who enjoys hikes through nature I thought I'd go check it out. This was an interesting journey requiring a Metrocable journey then switching to another super long cable car journey (15 mins non-stop). I don't consider myself scared of heights but Cable Cars have always felt a bit funny to me with the way they shake and move around. The view up was worth it though, seeing the entire city from above during the day. Getting to the park itself was a bit of a let down however, theres a fairly expensive secured trail, or you can ""take the risk"" and walk on other trails but they seemed to be mostly rural roads. The weather had also taken a turn for the worse. I walked along one trail but it was so wet and slippery that I decided I'd had enough after that. I made the long journey all the way back down into the city, heading to the Parque Natural Cerro El Volador. Here I watched the sunset and again saw the night lights start to flicker on. I stayed up here for so long that a security guard came and kicked me out as it turns out the park closes at 5PM! Well worth getting chewed out in Spanish though.

**Day 6 -** Upon arriving, my hotel host insisted on a guided tour to Guatapé. It looked interesting but I kinda brushed it off as I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 100k COP on a day out. I wasn't even sure I would have time to go. I decided I'd try my luck at doing it myself. I find guided tours to be sometimes rushed, sometimes too slow - I just prefer to set my own pace. I took a bus from Terminal del Norte, which took about 2 hours to get to. It was a fun physical experience to climb the Rock of Guatape, and theres some fantastic views. I then walked to the old town which was about 40 minutes walk, and thought cute its fairly small and I had seen everything I wanted after about an hour. I made my way back to Medellin, ate a Sancocho which was delicious and then packed my bag.

[View from Top of Guatape Rock](https://preview.redd.it/el74kdylnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ced1a7330388a5fe1f3e6e9045f69c241c062ef)

Medellin was the city I was most excited to visit on this trip - I'd seen videos of the city crawling up the sides of the valley and how pretty it looks at night. I was not disappointed at all. Every night I went to a different spot to view the lights and had my breath taken away. I stayed in the El Poblado area which is gentrified but safe. I do wish I was able to spend an extra day or two here though as there was so much more I would like to see. I will be back for sure. 

**Panama City - 2 Days**  
**Day 7 -**  Took an early morning flight to Panama City. Weather here scuppered my plans, I had a stroll along the Cinta Costera down along to San Felipe and the Panama Canal Museum. San Felipe was a beautiful little colonial town, and the museum was interesting, though I was extremely unlucky in being there at the same time as a very rowdy school group.   
**Day 8 -** Second morning I was planning to hike up the Cerro Ancon Reserve, but again the weather was pretty bad and I didn't really want to be climbing a hill in the rain to potentially have a pretty cloudy and grey view. Sort of had a bit of a lie in as I was a little bit drained from the past week. Took an Uber to Panama Viejo and then another Uber to Miraflores Visitor Centre to check out the Panama Canal. This was extremely cool to see in person, though the ticket was a bit pricey. Took a bus back into the city, visiting Albrook Mall for a fast food dinner and an early night. 

https://preview.redd.it/5kd5ug14oxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25c5ba8b9fdab8ed26b7929b723c6a07e8e3f90f

I was a bit unlucky with my time in Panama - the weather was pretty bad with plenty of heavy rain, and this seemed to cause problems with the municipal sewage system because it smelt like sewage everywhere I went in the city, especially close to the coast. This also stopped my checking out Metropolitan National Park and Cerro Ancon Reserve, so I had to rearrange my plans, though I was happy I managed to get in some more rest time. Whilst I don't think I'll go out of my way to visit Panama again, with how Copa connects most of Latin America I think it is inevitable I will spend more time there in the future - hopefully with some better luck. 

**Bogota - 3 Days**  
**Day 9 -**  As usual, a morning flight, land into Bogota before lunch. Grab a bus to my hotel - though I misread somewhere that you cold use contactless card, I forgot to buy the Tarjeta Tullave but the bus driver let me on anyways. Very lucky here. There is a kiosk in the airport just at the exit to the bus stops which I completely missed. Dropped my bags at the hotel and instantly feel the altitude sickness hit me. I'm asthmatic and the shortness of breath and dizziness hit me hard. Luckily in Colombia you can purchase many medicines without a prescription, so I got some **Acetazolamide** and refilled on my asthma inhalers whilst here as they are so cheap. The medication worked fairly quickly and I was ready to get on with the rest of the day. Purchased my travel pass at the nearest Transmilenio stop I went to check out the Museo Nacional de Colombia then walked along Carrera 7 down to Plaza de Bolivar. Picked up some souvenirs and soaked in the atmosphere - there was A LOT going on. Its colourful, noisy, chaotic and I generally enjoyed it. 

[Plaza de Bolivar](https://preview.redd.it/0j7fudylnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=020214446f3283d6dc6d6b60dbf74ff44985e23a)

**Day 10 -** I was fairly fatigued on this day, I'm unsure if it was related to the altitude sickness or maybe the fact I'd been going at it full pelt for 10 days at this point. Had a lie in and then checked out the Grafiti District, Botanical Garden, Simon Bolivar Park and then Zona T. The Botanical Garden and Simon Bolivar Park weren't really too special to go out of my way for so I somewhat regret it. 

[Botanical Garden](https://preview.redd.it/it2vzzwlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2ab4dcfb1a28753cde7a9466584b5f5608cc076)

**Day 11 -** My last day 🙁 My flight back home was at 11PM however, so I still had the entire day. I checked out as late as I could, then headed back down towards Plaza Bolivar. My original intentions were to hike up to Monseratte, but with how I was still adjusting to the altitude, I decided to err on the side of caution and take the cable car insted. It is quite an experience being up at 10.5k feet/3k metres. The view was stunning, and you're able to see the other side which is green covered mountains. I headed back down, but unfortunately as it was a Monday, the Museo del Oro and Museo Santa Clara were closed. This is a complete oversight on my part, and had I known I probably would have flipped Day 10 and 11 around. I walked down to Plazoleta Los Martires, which I do not recommend - theres some interesting colonial architecture but the area is very very dodgy. I went back to my hotel in Zona T, had some dinner and then made my way to the airport arriving at about 9PM for my 11:30PM departure. 

[View from Monserrat](https://preview.redd.it/dcxoqzwlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4387abdf28e22e6d743b1a4fb48ac2c1f822f0e4)

I think a lot of tourists skip Bogota because they hear bad things about it. Its dirty, theres a lot of poverty, but honestly it felt so gritty and grounded I loved it. I wish I had more time here - there are so many waterfalls and cool hikes to do in the areas surrounding the city, but I would need to fully acclimate to the altitude for that.  
Transmilenio has to be the most complicated Transit system I have ever used. When first seeing the map I thought the colours referred to individual lines, but they refer to ""trunks"" and bus routes operate down a combination of these different trunks. The majority of buses also do not serve all of the stops on the trunks, so you need to know which bus route to get. With so many buses operating along these trunk routes, the buses stop at different points along the platform. Some of these bus platforms are so long that there is only a matter of 20-30 metres in between the individual bus stops in some places. Once you get the hang of things it kind of makes sense ? But even Google Maps gets confused and seems to completely avoid integrating the BRT routes into transportation options in the city. Instead, you have to use Moovit, which whilst it gives you directions, sometimes doesn't offer the most efficient routes and is also plagued with adverts. The last thing I want to do when referencing my directions is have my phone out in the open for another 5-10 seconds waiting for this ad to finish. 

**Overall thoughts:**

I'm a very fast paced traveller. I get bored in one place too easily if I'm there for too long. My time was limited by work and Annual Leave requirements. I do not really get easily exhausted from taking flights, and do not consider it a chore/tedious. I know a lot of people seem to consider needing to dedicate a whole day to travelling, but in my opinion, if your trip is fairly short then you can afford to spend the energy travelling in the morning and then exploring in the afternoon. I also have a lot of stamina - I walked on average 25k steps a day for the whole trip. My shoes soles wore out pretty brutally. A lot of what I walked could easily have been Uber'd if a bit more pressed for time, but I really enjoy soaking up the neighbourhoods as I go between places. 

I'm lucky in the sense that I'm ethnically ambiguous and able to blend in to a wide variety of countries. I'm not Latin American but I have frequently been mistaken for a local in Mexico, and now, Colombia - with museum staff asking me for my local ID so I can get the national rate, then me having to inform them I am a tourist. This fact helped me blend in when walking through some dodgier neighbourhoods, as well as not get approached by tourist traps (tour guides, souvenir sales people). Colombia is a very diverse country and I think many people could pass as a local with the right mannerisms.

A basic command of Spanish is needed. Many hospitality staff I interacted with did not speak English, even at museums and hotels - I did stay at 2 or 3 star hotels. I don't speak Spanish, though I am Filipino and our language has a heavy % of Spanish loan words. That, along with the fact I speak French (a related Romance language) helped me navigate Spanish signage as well as communicate some of my ideas with the locals. I know enough Spanish phrases to get by, but regret not investing more time in learning Spanish to connect with locals, many of whom were up for a conversation. I also made sure to have Spanish downloaded on my Google Translate app for a last resort in some situations.

Honestly, I think I fell in love with Colombia and its people. I want to have a better command of Spanish next time, instead of fumbling around the language like a toddler.

travel,Trip with parents in Asia,"My parents are in their 60s and love to travel, but they usually stick to Europe since they don’t feel comfortable going outside it due to language barriers (they don’t speak much English). We have traveled together to the US a few times, but I would love to take them somewhere in Asia next year for a new experience.

They are very active - they go to the gym, enjoy running, and can walk long distances without any problem (usually). That said, they aren’t big on strenuous activities like trekking for example. They enjoy trying new cuisines, exploring local culture, and sightseeing.

I am considering Thailand, Cambodia, or Vietnam for a 10-day trip as I would also love to visit these countries. Would any of these countries be suitable for my parents (and me)? Any other suggestions are more than welcome!

Preferably I was thinking we’d be gone for about 3/4 nights .

Interested in Jamaica maybe but we’ve never been to an all inclusive. Don’t want to go anywhere too far either.  Maybe the Upper peninsula of Michigan? Any recommendations are greatly appreciated

travel,Bachelor weekend in Lisbon,"Hi,

We are a large group of 15 (mostly French) guys going to Lisbon for a weekend during the last 2 weeks of November. I haven't been to Lisbon so looking for recommendations for restaurants (fun ones), bars, clubs and night itenaries. We are in our mid-30s so while we can still party we also need some comfort. Typically, we would start at a fun restaurant (rooftop bar?) and then hit the bars (bar hopping maybe) and end up at a club. But we also don't mind having the party dictate where we go. Given that we are 15 guys and are in our mid-30s we want to avoid being rejected at the door. So we probably need to make some reservations. I'm also open to other fun suggestions (boot tour with drinks? Football game? etc.).

travel,Ha Giang Loop tour - company recommendation needed,"Need advice Ha Giang Loop tour

Hey y’all 👋 I need some advice on which tour company to go with. Planning to travel end of November. After some digging I’ve shortlisted Nomadders, Be’s Home, Bibi, and Flipside. Within these I’m leaning towards nomadders & Be’s home mainly because they are small groups 8 people tops and no party, also their routes are focused on culture, local villages. Their accommodations are clean and private too unlike other big groups which I read. As I’m not into partying, not gonna stay in dorms and prefer very small groups preferably 5-6 people to enjoy the ride together. So I’d appreciate your input to recommend which one to go with and pls share your experiences as well.

travel,Trains vs Flights within Europe,"I’ve received a lot of advice to take trains instead of flights for my European itinerary (Amsterdam -> Munich -> Lucerne -> Paris -> Amsterdam). Using the Amsterdam to Munich leg as an example, the train journey takes 7.5 hours with a transfer in Cologne and costs €98-140, while a direct flight is just 1 hour 25 minutes and costs only $50. Even if you get to the airport two hours before your flight to deal with the security checks and everything, flying would still save significant time compared to the train option. Though people emphasize the hassle-free nature of train stations compared to airports, I'm struggling to see how the longer travel times and higher costs of rail travel could be justified for my route, and I wonder if, as a first-time European traveler, I'm missing some important perspective.",travel,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjja93/trains_vs_flights_within_europe/,2024-11-04 17:03:46

We (husband & wife, early 40s, decently well-traveled) recently returned from two weeks (Oct. 11 - 27) in this area of Europe and I thought I would report back on our trip. We have been to Italy (Naples, Rome, Orvieto, Florence, Pisa, Cinque Terre, and Bologna) but not Venice or Milan, and this was our first time to both Slovenia and Switzerland.  This trip was MUCH less structured than our typical trips – most of our schedules were open for simply exploring these places on foot.  I researched all of our destinations but we had very little purchased/scheduled in advance.  I’m happy to answer any questions about likes/dislikes or what we felt we did right/wrong.

3 nights/2.5 days in Ljubljana, which absolutely charmed the hell out of us.  Unbelievably friendly people, incredible food, fantastic wine, and just the best vibes.  We stayed in Old Town (our hotel was a 4^(th) floor walkup with a great view of the river, spacious in terms of European hotel rooms, budget-friendly, perfect location, with helpful and kind staff).  We pretty much just walked around the city, eating and drinking and taking photos, for 2.5 days.  Made friends with a wonderful bartender who recommended Vintgar Gorge.  Visited Ljubljana Castle, climbed the tower for beautiful views.  Peeked inside a church or two, did a little shopping, and did a Slovenian wine tasting with a great sommelier who really knew her stuff.  Picked up several bottles of wine to drink as we made our way through the rest of the trip (and one to bring home).

2 nights/2 days at Lake Bled.  This was the only portion of the trip during which we rented a car.  We wanted the flexibility to explore outside of Bled on our own schedules.  Truly beautiful.  Quite touristy (which we expected… touristy places are touristy for a reason!)  Ate more good food, drank more good wine.  Visited Bled Castle and took a boat out to the island.  Rented an apartment just across the street from the lake.  Spent a few hours hiking at Vintgar Gorge, which was stunning (and not a difficult hike).  Well worth it!

2 nights/2.5 days in Venice.  Returned the car in Ljubljana and took a shared van (GoOpti) from Ljubljana to Venice.  We looked at taking a train, but it would’ve doubled the transit time from 3 hours to 6.  GoOpti was affordable and efficient – highly recommend.  (Though a bit crowded with nine people in a nine passenger van).  Venice was incredible.  I did not expect to enjoy it as much as we did.  I expected the entire place to be crawling with people, but that was really only true around St. Mark’s Square.  Off the main area, we just wandered quiet alleys and ate cicchetti and drank spritzes.  The only organized thing we did in Venice was take the elevator up to the top of St. Mark’s Campanile where the views were incredible.  We purchased two day transit passes so that we could use the water buses, but mostly we walked everywhere.  Venice is unbelievably walkable.  We did take a water bus out to San Giorgio Maggiore at night to see the city lights.  Beautiful.  We otherwise didn’t get off the island.  Oh, we did do a gondola right which I was iffy about, but it was definitely one of those “you have to do it once” things and we really had fun.  Fantastic food all over Venice – only had one meal that didn’t wow me (duck ragu).

3 nights/2.5 days in Milan.  Took an evening train, leaving Venice after dinner, to Milan.  Our apartment was super neat – a sixth floor place with a private balcony with a fantastic view of the Duomo.  Even though we planned this trip just three weeks out, we were able to get tickets to see the Last Supper (that said, we had to pay several hundred for a guided tour, rather than just the 15e entry fee, because those sell out months in advance).  It was worth the money, though.  We visited Sforza Castle and saw Michelangelo’s unfinished Pieta, which was amazing.  If you’ve been to Florence and have seen his ‘hall of prisoners’ at Accademia, it’s similar to those.  Astounding.  We did the timed ticket elevator to the Duomo rooftop and that was insane.  So cool to see the Duomo in various states of aging/repair, and to see all the intricate details up close.  The exit from the rooftop spits you out right inside the Duomo so it was super nice to get to skip the entry line for the interior, too.  Highly recommend that route.  We didn’t have a single bad meal in Milan.  I know it’s not a city that’s well known for food, but everything we had was wonderful.  We aren’t big shoppers so we did not do any shopping in Milan, including at any of the very high fashion places. 

3 days/3 nights in the Lauterbrunnen Valley.  We left Milan early and took a train to Lauterbrunnen, arriving by lunchtime.  I waffled about where to stay, but ultimately decided Lauterbrunnen would be the most convenient (I feel like that was the right decision for us).  Took the trains to Wengen, Grindelwald, and Murren (cable car).  Did the small hike up/behind Staubbach Falls, then walked a long way to take the cable car to Murren.  One of the most beautiful walks of my life.  Glad we skipped the bus for most of that route.  Our hotel in Lauterbrunnen was fantastic.  We had a balcony with a view of the falls, and a window with a view of the river/valley.  Breakfast was included and was generous and delicious!  It was foggy when we went to Wengen and Gridelwald.  Very clear skies when we went to Murren.  Grindelwald was by far the most touristy of the villages we visited, but we still enjoyed it.  We even played a round of mini golf while drinking Swiss beers.  So much fun.  This whole area blew our minds – it was just insanely beautiful.

1.5 days/2 nights in Geneva.  Geneva was nice.  It’s a functioning, bustling city.  Old Town is really pretty.  We had a couple of really good meals, walked along the river front area, visited outside the UN headquarters.  Lots of walking and looking around.

Those who post here about how underrated Slovenia is – are absolutely correct.  Slovenia was the sleeper hit of our trip.  We cannot wait to return.",travel,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjlczg/trip_report_slovenia_n_italy_switzerland/,2024-11-04 18:27:02

travel,"Lake Garda, Italy 🇮🇹 ","While most people from all over the globe know / have heard of Lake Como, Lake Garda remains a bit of a regional home turf, with visitors hailing mostly from Germany and Austria as well as Italy itself. 

On our recent tour in May we visited both Lake Como (pics to follow in a separate post) and Lake Garda. In direct comparison, Lake Garda has more to offer and feels more diverse: while Riva dem Garda in the far north, with a stunning mountain backdrop, feels much like an alpine Austrian town and attracts many hikers, Sirmione on the southern shore has an undeniably Italian vibe to it. Other towns like Malcesine on the east side of the lake are beautiful but so so touristy. My favourite in terms of vibes is Salò on the western side: it’s quieter but rather posh.",travel,2026,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1giq16c,2024-11-03 15:56:13
travel,KLM - Payment Process (help!),"I have an interesting story with KLM. I booked two quite expensive tickets, from Rome to Lima (FCO-LIM). I purchased my ticket directly from KLM website.

I payed with debit card. The amount of money was taken off my card, but I saw in the banking app as a blocked amount, as always. After two weeks, I saw that the amount of money is available on my card. I quickly contacted KLM, they said that the payment went through, and everything is fine. After that, I contacted the bank, and they said that the payment was not taken by KLM for 12 days, so that is why I got the blocked amount of money back. After that, I wrote to KLM once again, TELLING them that I basically have tickets for free, and once again they said, that everything is fine. Did someone experienced something like this? What should I do? How can they charge me again, if I payed with debit card? Or once they realize that they don't have the money, will they invalidate my tickets?",travel,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gk2jml/klm_payment_process_help/,2024-11-05 09:02:08
travel,Mexico itinerary advice ,"Hi,

I am trying to plan a 14 day trip to Mexico in January and would like some advice from someone who has been.

We are keen on visiting Mexico City and Oaxaca so it’s likely this will take up the first week of our trip. We are travelling from Europe and there are direct flights to Mexico City so I thought this would be a great starting point for the trip and then fly to Oaxaca afterward to save time travelling. 

After visiting these cities we would like to explore some more of Mexico’s beach towns. 

The two options I am considering are staying in the Oaxaca region and travelling down to the pacific coast for a week and visiting a few towns. Perhaps Huatulco and Mazunte. Or let me know if there are any others people would suggest visiting? 

The other option I am looking at is flying into Cancun and visiting the Yucatàn and spending the second week of our trip here and flying back home from Cancun. Can anyone suggest a good 7 day itinerary for this region? 

We ideally don’t want to be going to super touristy places/ all inclusive resorts and i would rather not rent a car and use public transport if possible.

Any advice will be super appreciated!

Thanks! ",travel,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gk21kn/mexico_itinerary_advice/,2024-11-05 08:22:21

**Day 1:** Arrive in Edinburgh, drive to Glenshee area just outside Cairngorms National Park to stay the night.

**Day 2:** Depart Glenshee and head to Braemar Castle to take in a view and then go for a hike in Cairngorms, likely somewhere on the west side to split up driving. Spend the night in the Fort Augustus area.

**Day 3:** Depart Fort Augustus early and make our way to Portree stopping at Urquhart Castle and Eilean Donan along the way. Ideally get to Portree by early afternoon so we can get at least one sightseeing/activity in before nightfall. Spend the night in Portree.

**Day 4:** Full day on Isle of Skye doing all the things we missed the previous day. Spend the night in Portree again.

**Day 5:** Depart Portree and make our way to Fort William - perhaps take the ferry/long way so we can see the Glenfinnan Viaduct. Spend the night in Fort William.

**Day 6:** Day trip/sight see/hike/TBD. Spend the night in Fort William.

**Day 7:** Depart Fort William and head to Edinburgh Airport to drop the car and head to the city center. Goal is to be in the city center by noonish and spend the day doing Edinburgh things. Spend the night in Edinburgh.

**Day 8:** Full Edinburgh tourist day. Spend the night in Edinburgh.

**Day 9:** Depart from Edinburgh Airport in the AM.

My partner and I are flying from Minneapolis -> Toronto -> Frankfurt -> Istanbul. And the way home we’re flying Istanbul -> Paris -> Montreal-> Minneapolis. We booked our flights as one ticket through Air Canada, however the FRA -> IST and IST -> CDG are operated by Turkish Airlines. 
We were unable to pull up any info on our Turkish Airlines flights on their website with the PNR given by AC. So I called Turkish Air and they were able to find our info. 
However the Turkish air customer service then told me that in FRA on the way there and in CDG on the way back we need to exit, go pick up our luggage, and then recheck our luggage with Air Canada. Air Canada told me the opposite that our bags both ways will be checked through to our final destination. 
I’m not sure who to believe but if Turkish is correct then we’re screwed because our trip is in like 5 days but we’d need an airport transit visa for both Germany and France since we’d be leaving the international zones to get our bags.

cryptocurrency,We've gotta talk about Republicans and crypto,"Tl;dr: Don't vote based on your bags. Republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way Trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy.

I know, I know. We're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. Me too. But I hear the idea that ""Republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true.

https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031

First, Republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and Democrats aren't uniformly against it. My no-talent ass clown of a Senator (Roger Marshall) is a hardcore MAGA Republican but wildly anti-crypto. He called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with Elizabeth Warren to make stricter AML/KYC regulations. During the FTX debacle he even suggested that the SEC [shut down all crypto transactions in the US](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). Saying that Democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. When you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by Stand With Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are Democrats. Not to mention that Democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [DNC convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [Anthony Scaramucci has reportedly been working with Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. Saying Republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed.

Secondly, we've got to talk about Trump. Saying that Trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [His recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. In 2019 he said that [Bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [December of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam."" ([And he would know!](https://apnews.com/article/17e975d3ccba4a92a9b023dff8437b21)) But recently crypto has been very kind to him. [One of his wallets](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) has almost $6 million in it.

Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist, but It ***really seems like*** after Melania Trump made an [unspecified (large) amount of money on a bunch of NFT projects in 2021 and 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit), Donald [suddenly changed his tune on crypto and started issuing a bunch of NFTs](https://decrypt.co/249755/trump-credits-nfts-change-of-heart-bitcoin-crypto) himself. When the NFT market dried up, he pivoted and was [collecting 2% of every transaction on shitcoins called things like ""Trump Bucks"" and ""Save America""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-donald-trump-made-nft-213019678.html) netting him at least a half million dollars. And of course don't forget about his newest ~~scam~~ DeFi project World Liberty Financial, [where 75% of all protocol revenue goes to the Trump family](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g69fob/trump_family_gets_75_of_crypto_coin_revenue_has/) (who also has no liability) and who [couldn't keep their own website running](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) during the rollout even though there wasn't much interest in the project.

I'm sure it's clear how I feel about him, and if you want to vote for him, be my guest. But don't do it because you think he's ""pro-crypto"" and will pump your bags if he's elected.

https://preview.redd.it/sxtxfrmk8zyd1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=51868abee8cbcf201081e38fb3ce5761066636a1

It seems pretty clear that he has no idea what crypto is or how it works. He [can't work a crypto wallet well enough to buy a burger with it](https://youtube.com/shorts/HIv4cwkz16U?si=2zjUCdPTnYVN9l_q), tweeted that he'll make sure Bitcoin is ""[made in the USA](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1852033244729860397)"" and stumbled through a [recent interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/donald-trump-struggles-and-seems-confused-in-painful-crypto-interview-while-trying-to-change-topic/ar-AA1qGv5X), saying:

>""It's so important. It's crypto. It's AI. It's so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard.""

At the very best, he doesn't give a shit and will forget about and ignore it once it stops making him money, which effectively gives other countries the ability to set crypto regulation and reinforces the stereotype that crypto is super scammy. This point has been made over and over, but if we want the industry to grow sustainably for the long-term, [we need clear, effective regulation](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/22/tether-ceo-ardoino-says-he-expects-us-will-catch-up-in-crypto-regulation/), not benign neglect.

cryptocurrency," The fact so many guesses and theories of ""who"" satoshi is leads me to believe that he will never be found, pretty much it's not even worth trying. ","I see a Fox news reporter accuse Satoshi of being a undercover CIA agent, I see countless of people saying they are satoshi, I see people accused of being satoshi saying they are NOT satoshi, I see so many countless theories of who possibly it could be (and some of them are really good guesses)

but at the end of the day, so many people, so many questions, so little answers, it just seems like a dead-end. We had since 2008 to figure out who this mysterious person (or people) is, and we have not even come CLOSE to even solving a clue.

Some possible options: The FBI/CIA/Government has cracked his identity somehow, and are keeping the info private from the publci, and/or we have mentioned/accused Satoshi of being the real person, but we just never truly knew.

Of course, I do not condone or think it's a good idea to always be stalking for satoshi. If he wanted to be anonymous, and left alone, then I think that we should all respect that. But same time, I do find it extremely interesting and amusing how Satoshi will never be discovered, and I will always find the mystery behind it super fascinating.

Unless Satoshi decides to reveal to the world his identity himself, if he ever does.. until then, Satoshi watches the world baffled by his existence and disappearence.",CryptoCurrency,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gk42sj/the_fact_so_many_guesses_and_theories_of_who/,2024-11-05 10:58:15

cryptocurrency,Coinbase Support,"Just over 5 months ago I sent Flare from my Bifrost wallet to my Coinbase account. The Flare was never received. I sent Coinbase proof from flarescan that I had sent it to the right address and they logged the problem and gave me a reference number.

More or less every month, I have asked for an update and been told that the technical team is working on it and to be patient.

Today I asked for a further update. Initially, I was given the usual story, be patient, the technical team is working on it. Then after a couple of exchanges where I said five months was more than long enough to fix the issue, I was told that it had been fixed and to check my account! Needless to say the Flare was not in my account.

I was then given a new reference number since they accepted that the problem hadn’t been fixed.

But it is clear to me that nothing had been done in 5 months and I don’t expect anything to be done going forward.

I’m hoping someone who has been in this situation with Coinbase before can give me some advice on how to escalate this. Who do you turn to? What can you do?

cryptocurrency,Be wary of retrospective/backwards-looking analyses because they're easily very manipulated when there are too few data points/cycles,"**TL;DR**:

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Correlation does not imply causation

Most crypto predictions are retroactive studies that are cherry-picked to look good with past data but have no accuracy in predicting the future. They're complete guesswork and have a high chance of eventually failing in future cycles.

-------------------------

**Retrospective study**: A backwards-looking study that considers past data

**Prospective study**: A forwards-looking study that establishes a hypothesis first and then checks whether future data supports the hypothesis.

####**The problem with retrospective studies**

In general, prospective studies are always considered to be more trustworthy than retrospective studies of similar sample sizes. They are heavily affected by selection bias. There are exceptions for large-scale retroactive studies that have 10000+ data points that span decades.

In addition, many retrospective studies (especially in crypto) are completely manipulated because are **not properly set up with a hypothesis ahead of time**. Instead, they look for interesting patterns in past data until they find one. And then they establish a hypothesis AFTERWARDS to match that data. This is a huge taboo in statistics, and yet it happens all the time in crypto investing.

Using retrospective data to explain correlation without having a strong hypothesis created at the start of the study ends up looking like this XKCD comic:

https://xkcd.com/882/

Only the results that have an interesting narrative are published while the uninteresting ones are quietly discarded.

####**Too few crypto cycles for data points**

**Correlation does not imply causation, and past performance is no guarantee of future results.**

We really only have 3 past price cycles (since the 1st epoch didn't have stable markets):

* Epoch 2: 2012-2016
* Epoch 3: 2016-2020
* Epoch 4: 2020-2024
* Epoch 5: 2024-

A line can fit any 2 data points perfectly while a curve can fit any 3 data points perfectly.

That means any logarithmic, exponential, or 2nd-degree polynomial can perfectly-fit 3 crypto cycles. It's so easy to fit any chart type because there are so few crypto cycles for data points.

####**Prior notable predictions that failed**

* Rainbow Chart was plotted to perfect-fit previous cycles, and then it immediately failed before it lasted a full cycle and had to be revised.
* CBBI to perfect-fit previous cycles, and then it failed to last a single cycle because it didn't predict a double-peak
* It was said that no one who held BTC for over 4 years would have a loss. And then it was moved to 5 years, and then 6 years when each of those narratives failed in subsequent cycles.
* Bitcoin bull run starts 6 months BEFORE the halving is a false narrative that never happened
* Bitcoin bull run starts 6 months AFTER the halving is a false narrative that that only happened in Epoch 2
* Cycle dates are unpredictable:
  * BTC price hits a new ATH 5 days (Epoch 2), 145 days (Epoch 3), 85 days (Epoch 4) after the halving
  * BTC price hits a cycle peak 365 days (Epoch 2), 525 days (Epoch 3), 341/524 days (Epoch 4) after the halving
  * BTC large bull run starts -270 days and 225 days (Epoch 2, there are 2 pumps), -400 days (Epoch 3), 150 days (Epoch 4) after the halving

Just like before, many narratives will fail, and some will succeed. It's mostly just pure luck and guesses.

If you really want to establish a strong study, create **a prospective study with a strong hypothesis**, and then test it over 5+ epochs. Retroactive studies with few data points are just not trustworthy.",CryptoCurrency,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gjlvo5/be_wary_of_retrospectivebackwardslooking_analyses/,2024-11-04 18:47:58

cryptocurrency,UPDATE: How To Calculate Your Celsius Loss (Youtube Video),"Hi everyone, I made a YouTube video going over exactly how to calculate your Celsius loss as well as whiteboard out an example of the calculation for those that want to follow along. See here: [How to Calculate Your Celsius Loss: Full Koinly Article Walkthrough With Examples!](https://partners.countonsheep.com/CelsiusBankruptcyGuide-YTR)

A few months ago I made this post, [Celsius Bankruptcy: A Comprehensive Guide To Calculating Your Losses (With Examples!)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/1fe7egh/celsius_bankruptcy_a_comprehensive_guide_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), outlining exactly how to calculate your Celsius loss for Class 5 Earn creditors (the majority of people). A lot of people responded positively to this guide as there weren't many resources available online going over the calculation.

After posting this guide, the team at Koinly saw it and asked me to author and update to their blog to include the detailed calculation. After doing so, I decided to also make a video going over the article step by step and then also white boarding an example for others to follow along. The link to that video is at the top.

Hope this helps!

*Note: The first 30 min are me talking through the article, the last 15 min is me white boarding out example #1.

cryptocurrency,None of you will ever get the chance Bitcoin & ETH OGs got,"Most of you are in one of these options:

* Too attached to move away and learn other things more up to date and actually needed
* Too greedy you just want that 1000x project no need to DYOR, CT just tell me where to put my money, Lower the MK the better
* Too deep in the fantasies of what your project is overpromissing
* Too diversified in shitcoins (Warren Buffet strategy doesn't work in here)

If you ask what Bitcoin & Ethereum OGs were doing when they found those projects it was none of the above.

They were DYOR, talking to devs & reading the pros & cons of the projects, they all noticed how profitable it was to **mine** emphasis on this word. 

Remeber mining? Yeah that's what brought diamond hand into the projects, people that had to actually learn stuff to understand if the project was something worth their time, their effort, **to build on it**.

99% of these shitcoins around are just giving the tokens for free to VCs & influencers & exchanges, then overpromisse everything and never deliever besides more tokens on the market.

Was BTC & ETH like that when they started? 

  
Binance & other exchanges have not been anyones friend, they ruined this space along with ETH allowing so much shitcoin to popup as easy as one can fart.

The market is riddled with shit, and good tokens with good ideas will never be looked into because the market just wants that quick money. Let me tell you most of those stories of winner in memecoins are just marketing strategies.

The real winners are the tokencreators/influencers/exchanges, in few years retail will be completely drained at this pace, well at least stupid retail.

 

Now you think, but I have a good project!

Prob you don't, without mining there's no incentive to learn and build, devs will not join the project. If the vision is not clear & the utility isn't there then forget it. Bring on  layer after layer nobody gives a damn. 

Incentives are everything to bring talented people into your project **for free**

Now you're saying my project also has mining!

Ok, is the vision they promissed +2 years ago already here? This is crypto not a game that takes decades to build, if you have the devs & the money it should not be difficult to build.   
The only reason to drag stuff is no devs or  they noticed it wouldn't work but they don't want people to lose faith in the project
